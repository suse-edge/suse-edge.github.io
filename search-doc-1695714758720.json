Each method has their own benefits and drawbacks. Kiwi supports using the package manager from the host/build system, so it can build base images and derive images which don't contain a package manager, like opensuse/busybox. With Dockerfile, it's practically required to use a full base image like opensuse/tumbleweed. I won't go into details how a Dockerfile or a kiwi build works, I'll just tell about the interaction with OBS. First the kiwi_metainfo_helper service that you can add as a buildtime source service allows to substitute buildtime placeholders to use in you Dockerfile or kiwi configuration. You can find a list of the placeholders here: https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/openSUSE:Factory/obs-service-kiwi_metainfo_helper/README Another useful service is the replace_using_package_version service, that allows to replace a placeholder with the version of a RPM package.

It is based on the concept of a transactional server, where the entire operating system is treated as a single, immutable unit. This means that any changes to the system are made through atomic transactions, which can be rolled back if necessary. This approach provides increased security, reliability, and consistency, making it ideal for use in production environments. It includes only the essential components required to run container workloads and has a small footprint, making it ideal for running in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices or IoT devices. SLE Micro can be used as a single-node container host, Kubernetes cluster node, single-node KVM virtualization host or in public cloud. One of the main benefits of using SLE Micro is its open standards design, which allows users to explore commodity hardware from several vendors and build an open source-based software platform. This enables significant cost savings on both software and hardware while keeping full control of the technology stack strategy and roadmap. One example for the usage would be Telecom where SLE Micro is helping them unlock the cost-savings potential of open-source design for both software and hardware. With the open standards design, they can explore commodity hardware from several vendors and build an open source-based software platform using open standards such as Kubernetes with open source tools of their choice.

If the first node is down, the clients needs their API endpoint to be tweaked to point to another node (i.e.- for kubectl, using the -s flag or modifying the kubeconfig file) and the certificate won't be accepted as it doesn't contain the IP/hostname of that other node (it can be forced to be ignored using --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true for kubectl but that's not a good practice). Ideally a mechanism to expose the K3s API in a high availability scenario is required. This usually means running a load balancer outside of the K3s cluster to serve and redirect the requests to the K3s API endpoints, so if one of the servers fail, the load balancer will re-route the requests to the other ones. This solves the HA problem but it adds complexity as it requires an external service, which sometimes is not available (typically in non-cloud environments such as baremetal deployments). One approach can be to run a self-contained solution involving kube-vip to expose the K3s API over a virtual IP (optionally including a load balancer as well). This solves the HA problem but the certificate can still be a problem... but K3s got you covered. By using the --tls-san flag at K3s installation time, a list of IPs and/or hostnames can be provided for the certificate to be included as Subject Alternative Names, meaning the K3s API will be happily served from those IPs/hostnames, and if those are the ones being served by the VIP, the solution is now HA and certificate-proof!

It is a different kernel tuned to a specific use case. The real time kernel is tuned for lower latency at the cost of throughput. The real time kernel is not recommended for general purpose use, but in our case, this is the recommended kernel for Telco Workloads. There are 4 top features: Deterministic Execution: Get greater predictability – ensure critical business processes complete in time, every time and deliver high quality of service, even under heavy system loads. By shielding key system resources for high-priority processes, you can ensure greater predictability for time-sensitive applications. Low Jitter: The low jitter built upon the highly deterministic technology helps to keep applications synchronized with the real world. This helps services that need ongoing and repeated calculation. Priority Inheritance: Priority inheritance refers to the ability of a lower priority process to assume a higher priority when there is a higher priority process that requires the lower priority process to finish before it can accomplish its task. SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time solves these priority inversion problems for mission-critical processes. Thread Interrupts: Processes running in interrupt mode in a general-purpose operating system are not preemptible. With SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time these interrupts have been encapsulated by kernel threads, which are interruptible, and in turn allow the hard and soft interrupts to be preempted by user-defined higher priority processes. In our case, if you have installed a real time image like SLE Micro RT, kernel real time is already installed and you don't need to install it again. You could check it looking for the kernel and see if contains the rt string at the end of the kernel info: uname -r 5.14.21-150400.15.11-rt  For more information about the real time kernel, please visit https://www.suse.com/products/realtime/ "},{"title":"CPU Tuned Configuration​","type":1,"pageTitle":"SUSE Adaptive Telco Infrastructure Platform (ATIP)","url":"/docs/product/atip/features#cpu-tuned-configuration","content":"The first thing is to create a profile for the cpu cores we want to isolate.

Normally it's the first VF of the card, so the last name will be consecutive after VF creation. The config map consists of a JSON file that describe devices using filters to discover and creates some groups for the interfaces. The most important is to understand the filters and the groups. The filters are used to discover the devices and the groups are used to create the interfaces. For example, we could filter using: vendorID: 8086 (Intel)deviceID: 0d5d (FEC)driver: vfio-pci (SRIOV driver)pfNames: p2p1 (PF name) We could also set placesholders like: pfNames: [&quot;eth1#1,2,3,4,5,6&quot;]  Regarding the groups, we could create a group for the FEC card and another group for the Intel card even creating some prefix depending our use case: resourceName: pci_sriov_net_bh_dpdkresourcePrefix: Rancher.io There are a lot of combinations in order to discover and create the resource group to allocate some VFs to the pods.

"},{"title":"Ignition vs Butane vs Combustion​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Intro","url":"/docs/quickstart/slemicro-utm-aarch64#ignition-vs-butane-vs-combustion","content":"Ignition is a provisioning tool that enables you to configure a system according to your specification on the first boot. When the system is booted for the first time, Ignition is loaded as part of an initramfs and searches for a configuration file within a specific directory (on a USB flash disk, or you can provide a URL). All changes are performed before the kernel switches from the temporal file system to the real root file system (before the switch_root command is issued). Ignition uses a configuration file in the JSON format. The file is called config.ign. SLE Micro supportsIgnition config spec 3.3.0(seehttps://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.3/single-html/SLE-Micro-deployment/#sec-ignition-configurationfor more information). Ignition files can be complex to generate manually (specially for the file permissions syntax in hex or multiline things) so you can useopensuse.github.io/fuel-ignitionto help you generate a basic one. Butane is a more human readable (and writable) configuration syntax based on yaml that can be translated to Ignition easily with the butane CLI as Butane is not consumable by Ignition. Combustion is a dracut module that enables you to configure your system on its first boot. Combustion reads a provided file called scriptand executes commands in it and thus performs changes to the file system. You can use Combustion to change the default partitions, set users' passwords, create files, install packages, etc. The Combustion dracut module is invoked after the ignition.firstbootargument is passed to the kernel command line. Combustion then reads the configuration from script. Combustion tries to configure the network, if the network flag has been found in script. After /sysroot is mounted, Combustion tries to activate all mount points in /etc/fstab and then call transactional-update to apply other changes (like setting root password or installing packages).

"},{"title":"Installation​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Intro","url":"/docs/quickstart/nvidia-slemicro#installation","content":"Currently, the required packages for the NVIDIA open driver are not available in standard SLE Micro package repositories, only SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), so we need to pull them from those repositories, which we can easily do via the toolbox utility. Note that this will not be required in coming weeks - we're currently making these packages available in SLE Micro, so the next few steps will become redundant. In the meantime, ensure that you've got the mounts.conf file setup correctly, this will ensure that any containers started by podman (which includes the toolbox utility) will automatically have your SUSE Connect credentials injected into the image. This will allow package access so we can download the packages from the SLES repositories (this file is usually already configured on SLE Micro 5.3, but let's make sure): cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; /etc/containers/mounts.conf # This configuration file specifies the default mounts for each container of the # tools adhering to this file (e.g., CRI-O, Podman, Buildah). The format of the # config is /SRC:/DST, one mount per line. #/etc/SUSEConnect:/etc/SUSEConnect /etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials:/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials EOF  Next, make a temporary directory in which we can push the packages that we need to download from SLES onto the local filesystem, for this I'm just using /root/nvidia: mkdir -p /root/nvidia  Now we can open up the toolbox utility, which provides additional command line tooling and utilities that are not part of SLE Micro's base operating system. This tool is useful for troubleshooting a system where you want to maintain a minimal footprint underlying operating system: toolbox  Once we're in the toolbox utility, we can ask the package manager (zypper) to add the sle-module-basesystem module, refresh the repositories, and then download the NVIDIA driver packages into the previously created /root/nvidia directory on the host filesystem, noting that from within toolbox the absolute path is /media/root/root/nvidia. In the example below we're specifically pulling the &quot;G06&quot; generation of driver, which supports the latest GPU's (please see here for further information), so please ensure that you're selecting an appropriate GPU version. In addition, the example below calls for 535.86.05 of the driver; please make sure that the driver version that you're selecting is compatible with your GPU, and in addition meets the CUDA requirements (if applicable) by checking here. It's also advisable to check the NVIDIA SLE15-SP4 repository to ensure that the driver version that you've chosen has an equivalent nvidia-compute-utils-G06 package with the same version string; this repository is regularly refreshed by NVIDIA, but the versions need to match; there's a possibility that we have a newer driver version in the SUSE repo than NVIDIA has in theirs (or vice versa), so it's important to match the versions here. When you've confirmed the above, use the following commands to pull the required packages appropriate for your system: ADDITIONAL_MODULES=sle-module-basesystem zypper ref zypper --pkg-cache-dir /media/root/root/nvidia install -y --download-only nvidia-open-driver-G06-signed-kmp=535.86.05  Now that you've got the packages available outside of the toolbox utility, exit the toolbox: exit  NOTE: Please make sure that you've exited the toolbox utility before proceeding! Now you're ready to install the packages on the host operating system, and for this we need to open up a transactional-update session, which creates a new read/write snapshot of the underlying operating system so we can make changes to the immutable platform (for further instructions on transactional-update see here): transactional-update shell  When you're in your transactional-update shell, add the additional required package repositories from NVIDIA; this will allow us to pull in additional utilities, e.g. nvidia-smi, along with access to CUDA packages that you may want to utilise: zypper ar https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/sles15/x86_64/ nvidia-sle15sp4-cuda zypper ar http://download.nvidia.com/suse/sle15sp4/ nvidia-sle15sp4-main  Next, move to the /root/nvidia directory, which will contain a couple of directories that the previous zypper command created with the downloaded packages from SLES. Then, we can request that the package manager install the pre-built signed kernel modules, the firmware packages, and the additional useful utilities package: cd /root/nvidia/container-suseconnect-zypp:SLE-Module-Basesystem15-SP4-Updates/x86_64 zypper in -y nvidia-open-driver-G06-signed-kmp-default* kernel-firmware-nvidia-gspx-G06* nvidia-compute-utils-G06  NOTE: If this fails to install it's likely that there's a dependency mismatch between the selected driver version and what NVIDIA is shipping in their repositories - please revisit the section above to validate that your versions match; it may require you to remove files from /root/nvidia and re-execute the commands starting from toolbox. Now that you've installed these packages, it's time to exit the transactional-update session: exit  NOTE: Please make sure that you've exited the transactional-update session before proceeding! Next, if you're not using a supported GPU, remembering that the list can be found here, you can see if the driver will work by enabling support at the module level, but your mileage may vary -- skip this step if you're using a supported GPU: sed -i '/NVreg_OpenRmEnableUnsupportedGpus/s/^#//g' /etc/modprobe.d/50-nvidia-default.conf  Now that you've got your drivers installed, it's time to reboot, as SLE Micro is an immutable operating system it needs to reboot into the new snapshot that you created in a previous step; the drivers are only installed into this new snapshot, and hence it's not possible to load the drivers without rebooting into this new snapshot, which will happen automatically. Issue the reboot command when you're ready: reboot  Once the system has rebooted successfully, log back in and try to use the nvidia-smi tool to verify that the driver is loaded successfully and that it's able to both access and enumerate your GPU(s): nvidia-smi  The output of this command should show you something similar to the following output, noting that in the example below we have two GPU's: Mon Sep 18 06:58:12 2023 +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | NVIDIA-SMI 535.86.05 Driver Version: 535.86.05 CUDA Version: 12.2 | |-----------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | GPU Name Persistence-M | Bus-Id Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

You've successfully installed and verified that the NVIDIA drivers are loaded into SLE Micro. "},{"title":"Further Validation​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Intro","url":"/docs/quickstart/nvidia-slemicro#further-validation","content":"At this stage, all we've been able to verify is that at the host level the NVIDIA device can be accessed and that the drivers are loading successfully. However, if we want to be sure that it's functioning, a simple test would be to try and validate that the GPU can take instruction from a user-space application, ideally via a container, and through the CUDA library, as that's typically what a real workload would utilise. For this, we can make a further modification to the host OS by installing the nvidia-container-toolkit. First, open up another transactional-update shell, noting that we could have done this in a single transaction in the previous step, but to many (e.g. customers wanting to use Kubernetes) this step won't be required: transactional-update shell  Next, install the nvidia-container-toolkit package, which comes from one of the repo's that we configured in a previous step. Note that this command will initially appear to fail as it has a dependency on libseccomp, whereas this package is libseccomp2 in SLE Micro, so you can safely select the second option (&quot;break dependencies&quot;) here: zypper in install nvidia-container-toolkit  Your output should look like the following: Refreshing service 'SUSE_Linux_Enterprise_Micro_5.4_x86_64'. Refreshing service 'SUSE_Linux_Enterprise_Micro_x86_64'. Refreshing service 'SUSE_Package_Hub_15_SP4_x86_64'. Loading repository data... Reading installed packages... Resolving package dependencies... Problem: nothing provides 'libseccomp' needed by the to be installed nvidia-container-toolkit-1.14.1-1.x86_64 Solution 1: do not install nvidia-container-toolkit-1.14.1-1.x86_64 Solution 2: break nvidia-container-toolkit-1.14.1-1.x86_64 by ignoring some of its dependencies Choose from above solutions by number or cancel [1/2/c/d/?] (c): 2 (...)  NOTE: We're working on fixing this dependency issue, so this should be a lot cleaner in the coming weeks. When you're ready, you can exit the transactional-update shell: exit  ...and reboot the machine into the new snapshot: reboot  NOTE: As before, you will need to ensure that you've exited the transactional-shell and rebooted the machine for your changes to be enacted. Now that the machine has rebooted, you can validate that the system is able to successfully enumerate the devices via the NVIDIA container toolkit (the output should be verbose, and it should provide a number of INFO and WARN messages, but no ERROR messages): nvidia-ctk cdi generate --output=/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml  When ready, you can then run a podman-based container (doing this via podman gives us a good way of validating access to the NVIDIA device from within a container, which should give confidence for doing the same with Kubernetes), giving it access to the labelled NVIDIA device(s) that were taken care of by the previous command, based on SLE BCI and simply running bash: podman run --rm --device nvidia.com/gpu=all --security-opt=label=disable -it registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest bash  When we're in the temporary podman container we can install the required CUDA libraries, again checking the correct CUDA version for your driver here although the previous output of nvidia-smi should show the required CUDA version. In the example below we're installing CUDA 12.1 and we're pulling a large number of examples, demo's, and development kits so you can fully validate the GPU: zypper ar http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/sles15/x86_64/ cuda-sle15-sp4 zypper in -y cuda-libraries-devel-12-1 cuda-minimal-build-12-1 cuda-demo-suite-12-1  Once this has been installed successfully, don't exit from the container, we'll run the deviceQuery CUDA example, which will comprehensively validate GPU access via CUDA, and from within the container itself: /usr/local/cuda-12/extras/demo_suite/deviceQuery  If successful, you should see output that shows similar to the following, noting the Result = PASS message at the end of the command: /usr/local/cuda-12/extras/demo_suite/deviceQuery Starting...
