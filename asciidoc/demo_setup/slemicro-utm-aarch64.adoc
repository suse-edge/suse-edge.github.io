== OSX Virtualization

Virtualization of Linux hosts on OSX can be achieved with various tools.
There are commercial products such as VMWare Fusion or Parallels Desktop
as well as open-source projects such as VirtualBox, UTM or Lima.

UTM is an OSX application that uses QEMU under the hood and offers a GUI
to manage the VM lifecycle. It supports Apple silicon CPUs, and it can
use native OSX virtualization (Virtualization.framework) as well. It
also has a scripting interface via https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/scripting/[Apple
Script] to automate some
processes and a proper CLI (utmctl) is on the works.

Lima is based on QEMU (experimental support for
Virtualization.framework) as well and it launches Linux virtual machines
with automatic file sharing and port forwarding (like WSL2), and
containerd. Lima is expected to be used on macOS hosts, but can be used
on Linux hosts as well. Lima has a proper CLI tool (limactl) and the
best part is VMs can be defined in yaml files, so you can even deploy
K8s clusters with just a single command
(see https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master/examples/k8s.yaml)

[NOTE]
====
Rancher desktop is https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop/issues/3702[based on Lima]
====

However, Lima doesn't support SUSE Linux Micro
(https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/issues/1456[yet]) as Lima customizes
the VM at boot to install some packages and services and SUSE Linux Micro uses a
different approach to those things (for example as it is immutable, it
requires installing packages using ignition/combustion)

== SUSE Linux Micro installation automation: ISO vs Image

SUSE Linux Micro can be installed traditionally using an ISO file that boots
once and using click-ops you can customize it as you wish
(see https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.3/single-html/SLE-Micro-deployment/#cha-install)
but that won't be useful.

ISO installation can be customized using boot parameters
(see https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.3/single-html/SLE-Micro-deployment/#sec-boot-parameters-list)
but those don't cover all the options. However, ISO based installation
supports using AutoYaST (see https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.3/single-html/SLE-Micro-autoyast/)
to automate the installation process.

SUSE Linux Micro can be also deployed using pre-built images. Currently, there
are two types of images available: raw disk images and selfinstall ISOs.

SUSE Linux Micro raw images are delivered for the AMD64/Intel 64 architecture,
IBM Z ZSeries and also AArch64, however the selfinstall images are
currently delivered only for the AMD64/Intel 64 architecture. The
pre-built images (both selfinstall ISOs and raw disk images) are
intended to be configured on the first boot by using either Ignition or
Combustion.

_To summarize_, the two ways as of today to deploy SUSE Linux Micro on Aarch64
on an automated fashion would be using the ISO + AutoYaST or raw
images + Ignition/Combustion.

== Ignition vs Butane vs Combustion

Ignition::
is a provisioning tool that enables you to configure a
system according to your specification on the first boot. When the
system is booted for the first time, Ignition is loaded as part of an
initramfs and searches for a configuration file within a specific
directory (on a USB flash disk, or you can provide a URL). All changes
are performed before the kernel switches from the temporal file system
to the real root file system (before the switch_root command is issued).
Ignition uses a configuration file in the JSON format. The file is
called config.ign. SUSE Linux Micro supports
https://coreos.github.io/ignition/configuration-v3_3/[Ignition config spec 3.3.0]
(see
https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.3/single-html/SLE-Micro-deployment/#sec-ignition-configuration
for more information).
+
Ignition files can be complex to generate manually (specially for the
file permissions syntax in hex or multiline things) so you can use
https://opensuse.github.io/fuel-ignition/[opensuse.github.io/fuel-ignition]
to help you generate a basic one.
+
Butane::
is a more human readable (and writable) configuration syntax
based on yaml that can be translated to Ignition easily with the https://coreos.github.io/butane/[butane
CLI] as Butane is not consumable by
Ignition.
+
Combustion::
is a dracut module that enables you to configure your
system on its first boot. Combustion reads a provided file called `script`
and executes commands in it and thus performs changes to the file
system. You can use Combustion to change the default partitions, set
users' passwords, create files, install packages, etc.
+
The Combustion dracut module is invoked after the `ignition.firstboot`
argument is passed to the kernel command line. Combustion then reads the
configuration from script. Combustion tries to configure the network, if
the network flag has been found in script. After `/sysroot` is mounted,
Combustion tries to activate all mount points in `/etc/fstab` and then
call `transactional-update` to apply other changes (like setting root
password or installing packages).
See https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.3/single-html/SLE-Micro-deployment/#sec-combustion-script
for more information.

== Ignition/Combustion and UTM

Ignition and Combustion are intended to automate the deployment of SLE
Micro systems. To use them with UTM there are a couple of alternatives:

* Use the QEMU `fw_cfg` flag as `-fw_cfg name=opt/org.opensuse.combustion/script,file=/var/combustion-script`
for combustion or `-fw_cfg name=opt/com.coreos/config,file=PATH_TO_config.ign` for ignition
* Create a raw disk or ISO file to host the Ignition or Combustion (or
both) files.

For Ignition, the configuration file `config.ign` must reside in the
`ignition` subdirectory on the configuration media labeled `ignition`. The
directory structure must look as follows:

[,shell]
----
<root directory>
└── ignition
    └── config.ign
----

For Combustion, the configuration device needs to be named `combustion`, a
specific directory structure in that configuration medium needs to be
created and include a configuration file named `script`. In the root
directory of the configuration medium, create a directory called
`combustion` and place the `script` into this directory along with other
files--SSH key, configuration files, etc. The directory structure then
should look as follows:

[,shell]
----
<root directory>
└── combustion
    └── script
    └── other files
----

Combustion can be used along with Ignition. If you intend to do so,
label your configuration medium `ignition` and include the `ignition`
directory with the `config.ign` to your directory structure as shown
below:

[,shell]
----
<root directory>
└── combustion
    └── script
    └── other files
└── ignition
    └── config.ign
----

In this scenario, Ignition runs before Combustion.

== Image-based process step by step

[TIP]
====
There is a helper script that automates all the steps included https://github.com/suse-edge/misc/blob/main/slemicro/create_vm.sh[here].
====

=== Prerequisites

* SUSE Linux Micro raw image
 ** Download the raw image file from the SUSE website at https://www.suse.com/download/sle-micro/
  *** Select ARM architecture
  *** Look for the raw file (I.e.- `SLE-Micro.aarch64-5.3.0-Default-GM2.raw.xz`)
+
[NOTE]
====
You need to have a valid user on the SUSE site to be able to download the
file.
====
+
* Access to https://scc.suse.com/[SCC.suse.com] to generate a registration code
 ** Search for `SUSE Linux Micro` via the `Products` menu, select the arch/version then copy and manually activate the registration code
* Butane, qemu and cdrtools installed (using brew for example)
+
[,bash]
----
brew install butane cdrtools qemu
----

* UTM installed (using brew for example)
+
[,bash]
----
brew install --cask utm
----

[NOTE]
====
If using the previous script, it is required to install UTM
4.2.2 at least as it includes the proper support for the automation.
====

=== Image preparation

* Uncompress the SUSE Linux Micro image
+
[,bash]
----
xz -d ~/Downloads/SLE-Micro.*-Default-GM2.raw.xz
----

* Move the file to a proper location and rename it to fit the VM
hostname
+
[,bash]
----
cp ~/Downloads/SLE-Micro.*-Default-GM2.raw ~/VMs/slemicro.raw
----

* Resize the image file. In this example, to 30G
+
[,bash]
----
qemu-img resize -f raw ~/VMs/slemicro.raw 30G > /dev/null
----

=== Ignition & Combustion files

To automate the installation, we will leverage Butane, Ignition and
Combustion as explained before:

* Create a temporary folder to store the assets
+
[,bash]
----
TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d)
----

* Create the required folders for ignition and combustion
+
[,bash]
----
mkdir -p ${TMPDIR}/{combustion,ignition}
----

* Create a `config.fcc` butane config file as required. See the
following example to set a `root` password for the root user, and to
configure the hostname to be "slemicro"'
+
[,yaml]
----
cat << 'EOF' > ${TMPDIR}/config.fcc
variant: fcos
version: 1.4.0
storage:
  files:
    - path: /etc/hostname
      mode: 0644
      overwrite: true
      contents:
        inline: "slemicro"
passwd:
  users:
   - name: root
     password_hash: "$y$j9T$/t4THH10B7esLiIVBROsE.$G1lyxfy/MoFVOrfXSnWAUq70Tf3mjfZBIe18koGOuXB"
EOF
----

* Create a script combustion file as required. See the following
example to register the SUSE Linux Micro instance to SUSE's SCC (use your
own email/regcode) and to create a `/etc/issue.d/combustion` file
+
[,bash]
----
cat << EOF > ${TMPDIR}/combustion/script
#!/bin/bash
# combustion: network

# Redirect output to the console
exec > >(exec tee -a /dev/tty0) 2>&1

# Set hostname at combustion phase for SUSEConnect
hostname slemicro

# Registration
if ! which SUSEConnect > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    zypper --non-interactive install suseconnect-ng
fi

SUSEConnect --email foobar@suse.com --url https://scc.suse.com --regcode YOURCODE

# Leave a marker
echo "Configured with combustion" > /etc/issue.d/combustion
EOF
----

* Convert the butane config to ignition
+
[,bash]
----
butane -p -o ${TMPDIR}/ignition/config.ign ${TMPDIR}/config.fcc
----

* Create an ISO file. It is requried for both ignition and combustion
to work that the ISO is labeled as `ignition` (hence the -V
parameter)
+
[,bash]
----
mkisofs -full-iso9660-filenames -o ignition-and-combustion.iso \
 -V ignition ${TMPDIR}
----

* *Optional:* Remove the temporary folder
+
[,bash]
----
rm -rf ${TMPDIR}
----

=== VM Creation

Now it is time to finally use UTM to boot the VM

image::utm-welcome.png[width=90%]

Create a New Virtual Machine using Virtualization

image::utm-start.png[width=90%]

Select "Other"

image::utm-os.png[width=90%]

Enable the "Skip ISO boot" option as we will use the raw disk directly

image::utm-other.png[width=90%]

Select the required CPU/RAM:

image::utm-hardware.png[width=90%]

Accept the storage size as it is, it will be deleted before booting it

image::utm-storage.png[width=90%]

Skip the Shared Directory

image::utm-shared-directory.png[width=90%]

Edit the VM name and enable the "Open VM Settings" toggle to customize
it further:

image::utm-summary.png[width=90%]

Delete the VirtIO Drive

image::utm-delete-virtio.png[width=90%]

Add a new Drive and select "Import"

image::utm-import-raw.png[width=90%]

Select the raw image file (~/VMs/slemicro.raw in this case)

image::utm-select-image.png[width=90%]

Repeat the last two steps to add the ignition-and-combustion.iso file

image::utm-select-iso.png[width=90%]

Configure the ISO as Read Only and "CD/DVD (ISO) Image"

image::utm-configure-iso.png[width=90%]

Finally, boot the VM.

After a couple of seconds, the VM will boot up and will configure itself
using the ignition and combustion scripts, including registering itself
to SCC

image::slemicro-firstboot.png[width=90%]

image::scc-systems.png[width=90%]

[TIP]
====
In case the VM doesn't get network connectivity, try
https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/discussions/3530#discussioncomment-5072113
====

[TIP]
====
Once the VM is running, you can access via SSH via its IP as `ssh root@<ip>`
====

== ISO Process (TBD)

* Download the ISO file
* Create a new VM on UTM using the ISO file
* Create the autoyast answer file
* Use the AutoYaST boot parameter to map to the answer file
* Boot the VM
* Profit!
