Metal^3^ is a https://metal3.io/[CNCF project] which provides bare-metal infrastructure
management capabilities for Kubernetes.

Metal^3^ provides Kubernetes-native resources to manage the lifecycle of bare-metal servers
which support management via out-of-band protocols such as https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish[Redfish].

It also has mature support for https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/[Cluster API (CAPI)] which enables management
of infrastructure resources across multiple infrastructure providers via a broadly adopted vendor-neutral APIs.

== Why use this method

This method is useful for scenarios where the target hardware supports out-of-band management, and a fully automated
infrastructure management flow is desired.

A management cluster is configured to provide declarative APIs that enable inventory and state management of downstream
cluster bare-metal servers, including automated inspection, cleaning and provisioning/deprovisioning.

== High-level architecture

== Prerequisites

There are also some specific constraints related to the downstream cluster server hardware and networking:

* Management cluster
 ** Must have network connectivity to the target server management/BMC API
 ** Must have network connectivity to the target server control plane network
 ** https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/[Kubectl], https://podman.io[Podman] and https://helm.sh[Helm] need to be installed
 ** For multi-node management clusters, an additional reserved IP address is required
* Hosts to be controlled
 ** Must support out-of-band management via Redfish, iDRAC or iLO interfaces
 ** Must support deployment via virtual media (PXE is not currently supported)
 ** Must have network connectivity to the management cluster for access to the Metal^3^ provisioning APIs

=== Setup Management Cluster

The basic steps to install a management cluster and use Metal^3^ are:

. Install an RKE2 management cluster
. Install Rancher
. Install a storage provider
. Install the Metal^3^ dependencies
. Install CAPI dependencies
. Register BareMetalHost CRs to define the bare-metal inventory
. Create a downstream cluster by defining CAPI resources

This guide assumes an existing RKE2 cluster and Rancher (including cert-manager) has been installed, for example by following the <<quickstart-eib, Edge Image Builder quick start guide>>.

TIP: The steps here can also be fully automated as described in the <<atip-management-cluster, ATIP management cluster documentation>>.

=== Installing Metal^3^ dependencies

If not already installed as part of the Rancher installation, cert-manager must be installed and running.

A persistent storage provider must be installed. Longhorn is recommended but local-path can also be used for
dev/PoC environments. The instructions below assume a StorageClass has been
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-default-storage-class/[marked as default],
otherwise additional configuration for the Metal^3^ chart is required.

An additional IP is required, which is managed by https://metallb.universe.tf/[MetalLB] to provide a
consistent endpoint for the Metal^3^ management services.
This IP must be part of the control plane subnet and reserved for static configuration (not part of any DHCP pool).

TIP: If the management cluster is a single node, the requirement for an additional floating IP managed via MetalLB can be avoided, see <<Single-node configuration, Single-node configuration>>

. First, we install MetalLB:
+
[,bash]
----
helm install \
  metallb oci://registry.suse.com/edge/metallb-chart \
  --namespace metallb-system \
  --create-namespace
----
+
. Then we define an `IPAddressPool` and `L2Advertisment` using the reserved IP, defined as `STATIC_IRONIC_IP` below:
+
[,yaml]
----
export STATIC_IRONIC_IP=<STATIC_IRONIC_IP>

cat <<-EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: ironic-ip-pool
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - ${STATIC_IRONIC_IP}/32
  serviceAllocation:
    priority: 100
    serviceSelectors:
    - matchExpressions:
      - {key: app.kubernetes.io/name, operator: In, values: [metal3-ironic]}
EOF
----
+
[,yaml]
----
cat <<-EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: ironic-ip-pool-l2-adv
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
  - ironic-ip-pool
EOF
----
+
. Now Metal^3^ can be installed:
+
[,bash]
----
helm install \
  metal3 oci://registry.suse.com/edge/metal3-chart \
  --namespace metal3-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --set global.ironicIP="${STATIC_IRONIC_IP}"
----
+
. It can take around two minutes for the initContainer to run on this deployment, so ensure the pods are all running before proceeding:
+
[,shell]
----
kubectl get pods -n metal3-system
NAME                                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
baremetal-operator-controller-manager-85756794b-fz98d   2/2     Running   0          15m
metal3-metal3-ironic-677bc5c8cc-55shd                   4/4     Running   0          15m
metal3-metal3-mariadb-7c7d6fdbd8-64c7l                  1/1     Running   0          15m
----

WARNING: Do not proceed to the following steps until all pods in the `metal3-system` namespace are running

=== Installing cluster API dependencies

First, we need to disable the Rancher-embedded CAPI controller:

[,bash]
----
cat <<-EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: management.cattle.io/v3
kind: Feature
metadata:
  name: embedded-cluster-api
spec:
  value: false
EOF

kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io mutating-webhook-configuration
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io validating-webhook-configuration
kubectl wait --for=delete namespace/cattle-provisioning-capi-system --timeout=300s
----

Then, to use the SUSE images, a configuration file is needed:

[,bash]
----
mkdir ~/.cluster-api
cat >  ~/.cluster-api/clusterctl.yaml <<EOF
images:
  all:
    repository: registry.suse.com/edge
EOF
----

Install https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/quick-start.html#install-clusterctl[clusterctl] 1.6.x, after which we will install the core, infrastructure, bootstrap and control plane providers as follows:

[,bash]
----
clusterctl init --core "cluster-api:v1.6.2" --infrastructure "metal3:v1.6.0" --bootstrap "rke2:v0.2.6" --control-plane "rke2:v0.2.6"
----

After some time, the controller pods should be running in the `capi-system`, `capm3-system`, `rke2-bootstrap-system` and `rke2-control-plane-system` namespaces.

=== Adding BareMetalHost inventory

Registering bare-metal servers for automated deployment requires creating two resources: a Secret storing
BMC access credentials and a Metal^3^ BareMetalHost resource defining the BMC connection and other details:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: controlplane-0-credentials
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=
---
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
kind: BareMetalHost
metadata:
  name: controlplane-0
  labels:
    cluster-role: control-plane
spec:
  online: true
  bootMACAddress: "00:f3:65:8a:a3:b0"
  bmc:
    address: redfish-virtualmedia://192.168.125.1:8000/redfish/v1/Systems/68bd0fb6-d124-4d17-a904-cdf33efe83ab
    disableCertificateVerification: true
    credentialsName: controlplane-0-credentials
----

Note the following:

* The Secret user name/password must be base64 encoded. Note this should not include any trailing newlines (for example, use `echo -n`, not just `echo`!)
* The `cluster-role` label may be set now or later on cluster creation. In the example below, we expect `control-plane` or `worker`
* `bootMACAddress` must be a valid MAC that matches the control plane NIC of the host
* The `bmc` address is the connection to the BMC management API, the following are supported:
 ** `redfish-virtualmedia://<IP ADDRESS>/redfish/v1/Systems/<SYSTEM ID>`: Redfish virtual media, for example, SuperMicro
 ** `idrac-virtualmedia://<IP ADDRESS>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1`: Dell iDRAC
* See the https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/blob/main/docs/api.md[Upstream API docs] for more details on the BareMetalHost API

==== Configuring Static IPs

The BareMetalHost example above assumes DHCP provides the controlplane network configuration, but for scenarios where manual configuration
is needed such as static IPs it is possible to provide additional configuration, for example:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: controlplane-0-networkdata
type: Opaque
stringData:
  networkData: |
    interfaces:
    - name: enp1s0
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      mac-address: "00:f3:65:8a:a3:b0"
      ipv4:
        address:
        - ip:  192.168.125.200
          prefix-length: 24
        enabled: true
        dhcp: false
    dns-resolver:
      config:
        server:
        - 192.168.125.1
    routes:
      config:
      - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
        next-hop-address: 192.168.125.1
        next-hop-interface: enp1s0
---
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
kind: BareMetalHost
metadata:
  name: controlplane-0
  labels:
    cluster-role: control-plane
spec:
  preprovisioningNetworkDataName: controlplane-0-networkdata
# Remaining content as in previous example
----

==== BareMetalHost preparation

After creating the BareMetalHost resource and associated secrets as described above, a host preparation workflow is triggered:

* A ramdisk image is booted by virtualmedia attachment to the target host BMC
* The ramdisk inspects hardware details, and prepares the host for provisioning (for example by cleaning disks of previous data)
* On completion of this process, hardware details in the BareMetalHost `status.hardware` field are updated and can be verified

This process can take several minutes, but when completed you should see the BareMetalHost state become `available`:

[,bash]
----
% kubectl get baremetalhost
NAME             STATE       CONSUMER   ONLINE   ERROR   AGE
controlplane-0   available              true             9m44s
worker-0         available              true             9m44s
----


=== Creating downstream clusters

We now create Cluster API resources which define the downstream cluster, and Machine resources which will cause the BareMetalHost resources to
be provisioned, then bootstrapped to form an RKE2 cluster.

=== Control plane deployment

To deploy the controlplane we define a yaml manifest similar to the one below, which contains the following resources:

* Cluster resource defines the cluster name, networks, and type of controlplane/infrastructure provider (in this case RKE2/Metal3)
* Metal3Cluster defines the controlplane endpoint (host IP for single-node, LoadBalancer endpoint for multi-node, this example assumes single-node)
* RKE2ControlPlane defines the RKE2 version and any additional configuration needed during cluster bootstrapping
* Metal3MachineTemplate defines the OS Image to be applied to the BareMetalHost resources, and the hostSelector defines which BareMetalHosts to consume
* Metal3DataTemplate defines additional metaData to be passed to the BareMetalHost (note networkData is not currently supported in the Edge solution)

Note for simplicity this example assumes a single-node controlplane, where the BareMetalHost is configured with an IP of `192.168.125.200` - for more
advanced multi-node examples please see the <<atip-automated-provisioning, ATIP documentation>>

=== Worker/Compute deployment

Similar to the controlplane we define a yaml manifest, which contains the following resources:

* MachineDeployment defines the number of replicas (hosts) and the bootstrap/infrastructure provider (in this case RKE2/Metal3)
* RKE2ConfigTemplate describes the RKE2 version and first-boot configuration for agent host bootstrapping
* Metal3MachineTemplate defines the OS Image to be applied to the BareMetalHost resources, and the hostSelector defines which BareMetalHosts to consume
* Metal3DataTemplate defines additional metaData to be passed to the BareMetalHost (note networkData is not currently supported in the Edge solution)

== Known issues

* The upstream https://github.com/metal3-io/ip-address-manager[IP Address Management controller] is currently not supported, because it's not yet compatible with our choice of network configuration tooling and first-boot toolchain in SLEMicro.
* Relatedly, the IPAM resources and Metal3DataTemplate networkData fields are not currently supported.
* Only deployment via redfish-virtualmedia is currently supported.
* Deployed clusters are not currently imported into Rancher
* Due to disabling the Rancher embedded CAPI controller, a management cluster configured for Metal^3^ as described above cannot also be used for other cluster provisioning methods such as <<components-elemental, Elemental>>

== Planned changes

* Deployed clusters imported into Rancher, this is planned via https://turtles.docs.rancher.com/[Rancher Turtles] in future
* Aligning with Rancher Turtles is also expected to remove the requirement to disable the Rancher embedded CAPI, so other cluster methods should be possible via the management cluster.
* Enable support of the IPAM resources and configuration via networkData fields

== Additional resources

The <<atip, ATIP Documentation>> has examples of more advanced usage of Metal^3^ for telco use-cases.

=== Single-node configuration

For test/PoC environments where the management cluster is a single node, it is possible to avoid the requirement for an additional floating IP managed via MetalLB.

In this mode, the endpoint for the management cluster APIs is the IP of the management cluster, therefore it should be reserved when using DHCP
or statically configured to ensure the management cluster IP does not change - referred to as `<MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_IP>` below.

To enable this scenario the metal3 chart values required are as follows:

[,yaml]
----
global:
  ironicIP: <MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_IP>
metal3-ironic:
  service:
    type: NodePort
----

=== Disabling TLS for virtualmedia ISO attachment

Some server vendors verify the SSL connection when attaching virtual-media ISO images to the BMC, which can cause a problem because the generated
certs for the Metal3 deployment are self-signed, to work around this issue it's possible to disable TLS only for the virtualmedia disk attachment
with metal3 chart values as follows:

[,yaml]
----
global:
  enable_vmedia_tls: false
----

An alternative solution is to configure the BMCs with the CA cert - see `kubectl get secret -n metal3-system ironic-vmedia-cert -o yaml`
