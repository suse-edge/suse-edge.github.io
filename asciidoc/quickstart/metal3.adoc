Metal^3^ is a https://metal3.io/[CNCF project] which provides bare-metal infrastructure
management capabilities for Kubernetes.

Metal^3^ provides Kubernetes-native resources to manage the lifecycle of bare-metal servers
which support management via out-of-band protocols such as https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish[Redfish].

It also has mature support for https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/[Cluster API (CAPI)] which enables management
of infrastructure resources across multiple infrastructure providers via broadly adopted vendor-neutral APIs.

== Why use this method

This method is useful for scenarios where the target hardware supports out-of-band management, and a fully automated
infrastructure management flow is desired.

A management cluster is configured to provide declarative APIs that enable inventory and state management of downstream
cluster bare-metal servers, including automated inspection, cleaning and provisioning/deprovisioning.

== High-level architecture

image::quickstart-metal3-architecture.svg[]

== Prerequisites

There are some specific constraints related to the downstream cluster server hardware and networking:

* Management cluster
 ** Must have network connectivity to the target server management/BMC API
 ** Must have network connectivity to the target server control plane network
 ** For multi-node management clusters, an additional reserved IP address is required
* Hosts to be controlled
 ** Must support out-of-band management via Redfish, iDRAC or iLO interfaces
 ** Must support deployment via virtual media (PXE is not currently supported)
 ** Must have network connectivity to the management cluster for access to the Metal^3^ provisioning APIs

Some tools are required, these can be installed either on the management cluster, or on a host which can access it.

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/[Kubectl], https://helm.sh[Helm] and https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/quick-start.html#install-clusterctl[Clusterctl]
* A container runtime such as https://podman.io[Podman] or https://rancherdesktop.io[Rancher Desktop]

The `{micro-base-image-raw}` OS image file must be downloaded from the https://scc.suse.com/[SUSE Customer Center] or the https://www.suse.com/download/sle-micro/[SUSE Download page].

=== Setup Management Cluster

The basic steps to install a management cluster and use Metal^3^ are:

. Install an RKE2 management cluster
. Install Rancher
. Install a storage provider
. Install the Metal^3^ dependencies
. Install CAPI dependencies via Rancher Turtles
. Build a SLEMicro OS image for downstream cluster hosts
. Register BareMetalHost CRs to define the bare-metal inventory
. Create a downstream cluster by defining CAPI resources

This guide assumes an existing RKE2 cluster and Rancher (including cert-manager) has been installed, for example by using <<components-eib, Edge Image Builder>>.

TIP: The steps here can also be fully automated as described in the <<atip-management-cluster, Management Cluster Documentation>>.

=== Installing Metal^3^ dependencies

If not already installed as part of the Rancher installation, cert-manager must be installed and running.

A persistent storage provider must be installed. SUSE Storage is recommended but `local-path-provisioner` can also be used for
dev/PoC environments. The instructions below assume a StorageClass has been
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-default-storage-class/[marked as default],
otherwise additional configuration for the Metal^3^ chart is required.

An additional IP is required, which is managed by https://metallb.universe.tf/[MetalLB] to provide a
consistent endpoint for the Metal^3^ management services.
This IP must be part of the control plane subnet and reserved for static configuration (not part of any DHCP pool).

TIP: If the management cluster is a single node, the requirement for an additional floating IP managed via MetalLB can be avoided, see <<Single-node configuration>>

. First, we install MetalLB:
+
[,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
helm install \
  metallb oci://registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/metallb-chart \
  --namespace metallb-system \
  --create-namespace
----
+
. Then we define an `IPAddressPool` and `L2Advertisement` using the reserved IP, defined as `STATIC_IRONIC_IP` below:
+
[,bash]
----
export STATIC_IRONIC_IP=<STATIC_IRONIC_IP>

cat <<-EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: ironic-ip-pool
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - ${STATIC_IRONIC_IP}/32
  serviceAllocation:
    priority: 100
    serviceSelectors:
    - matchExpressions:
      - {key: app.kubernetes.io/name, operator: In, values: [metal3-ironic]}
EOF
----
+
[,bash]
----
cat <<-EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: ironic-ip-pool-l2-adv
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
  - ironic-ip-pool
EOF
----
+
. Now Metal^3^ can be installed:
+
[,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
helm install \
  metal3 oci://registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/metal3-chart \
  --namespace metal3-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --set global.ironicIP="$STATIC_IRONIC_IP"
----
+
. It can take around two minutes for the init container to run on this deployment, so ensure the pods are all running before proceeding:
+
[,shell]
----
kubectl get pods -n metal3-system
NAME                                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
baremetal-operator-controller-manager-85756794b-fz98d   2/2     Running   0          15m
metal3-metal3-ironic-677bc5c8cc-55shd                   4/4     Running   0          15m
metal3-metal3-mariadb-7c7d6fdbd8-64c7l                  1/1     Running   0          15m
----

WARNING: Do not proceed to the following steps until all pods in the `metal3-system` namespace are running.

=== Installing cluster API dependencies

Cluster API dependencies are managed via the Rancher Turtles Helm chart:

[,bash,subs="attributes,specialchars"]
----
cat > values.yaml <<EOF
rancherTurtles:
  features:
    embedded-capi:
      disabled: true
    rancher-webhook:
      cleanup: true
EOF

helm install \
  rancher-turtles oci://registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/rancher-turtles-chart \
  --namespace rancher-turtles-system \
  --create-namespace \
  -f values.yaml
----

After some time, the controller pods should be running in the `capi-system`, `capm3-system`, `rke2-bootstrap-system` and `rke2-control-plane-system` namespaces.

=== Prepare downstream cluster image

<<components-eib, Edge Image Builder>> is used to prepare a modified SLEMicro base image which is provisioned on downstream cluster hosts.

In this guide, we cover the minimal configuration necessary to deploy the downstream cluster.

==== Image configuration

When running Edge Image Builder, a directory is mounted from the host, so it is necessary to create a directory structure to store the configuration files used to define the target image.

* `downstream-cluster-config.yaml` is the image definition file, see <<quickstart-eib>> for more details.
* The base image when downloaded is `xz` compressed, which must be uncompressed with `unxz` and copied/moved under the `base-images` folder.
* The `network` folder is optional, see <<metal3-add-network-eib>> for more details.
* The custom/scripts directory contains scripts to be run on first-boot; currently a `01-fix-growfs.sh` script is required to resize the OS root partition on deployment

----

===== Downstream cluster image definition file

The `downstream-cluster-config.yaml` file is the main configuration file for the downstream cluster image. The following is a minimal example for deployment via Metal^3^:

[,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {version-eib-api-latest}
image:
  imageType: raw
  arch: x86_64
  baseImage: {micro-base-image-raw}
  outputImageName: SLE-Micro-eib-output.raw
operatingSystem:
  time:
    timezone: Europe/London
    ntp:
      forceWait: true
      pools:
        - 2.suse.pool.ntp.org
      servers:
        - 10.0.0.1
        - 10.0.0.2
  kernelArgs:
    - ignition.platform.id=openstack
    - net.ifnames=1
  systemd:
    disable:
      - rebootmgr
      - transactional-update.timer
      - transactional-update-cleanup.timer
  users:
    - username: root
      encryptedPassword: $ROOT_PASSWORD
      sshKeys:
      - $USERKEY1
  packages:
    packageList:
      - jq
  sccRegistrationCode: $SCC_REGISTRATION_CODE
----

Where `$SCC_REGISTRATION_CODE` is the registration code copied from https://scc.suse.com/[SUSE Customer Center], and the package list contains `jq` w
hich is required.

`$ROOT_PASSWORD` is the encrypted password for the root user, which can be useful for test/debugging.  It can be generated with the `openssl passwd -6 PASSWORD` command

For the production environments, it is recommended to use the SSH keys that can be added to the users block replacing the `$USERKEY1` with the real SSH keys.

[NOTE]
====
`net.ifnames=1` enables https://documentation.suse.com/smart/network/html/network-interface-predictable-naming/index.html[Predictable Network Interface Naming]

This matches the default configuration for the Metal^3^ chart, but the setting must match the configured chart `predictableNicNames` value.

Also note that `ignition.platform.id=openstack` is mandatory - without this argument SUSE Linux Micro configuration via ignition will fail in the Metal^3^ automated flow.

The `time` section is optional but it is highly recommended to configure it to avoid potential issues with certificates and clock skew. The values provided in this example are for illustrative purposes only. Please adjust them to fit your specific requirements.
====

===== Growfs script

Currently, a custom script (`custom/scripts/01-fix-growfs.sh`) is required to grow the file system to match the disk size on first-boot after provisioning. The `01-fix-growfs.sh` script contains the following information:

[,shell]
----
#!/bin/bash
growfs() {
  mnt="$1"
  dev="$(findmnt --fstab --target ${mnt} --evaluate --real --output SOURCE --noheadings)"
  # /dev/sda3 -> /dev/sda, /dev/nvme0n1p3 -> /dev/nvme0n1
  parent_dev="/dev/$(lsblk --nodeps -rno PKNAME "${dev}")"
  # Last number in the device name: /dev/nvme0n1p42 -> 42
  partnum="$(echo "${dev}" | sed 's/^.*[^0-9]\([0-9]\+\)$/\1/')"
  ret=0
  growpart "$parent_dev" "$partnum" || ret=$?
  [ $ret -eq 0 ] || [ $ret -eq 1 ] || exit 1
  /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-growfs "$mnt"
}
growfs /
----

[NOTE]
====
Add your own custom scripts to be executed during the provisioning process using the same approach.
For more information, see <<quickstart-eib>>.

====

==== Image creation

Once the directory structure is prepared following the previous sections, run the following command to build the image:

[,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
podman run --rm --privileged -it -v $PWD:/eib \
 registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/edge-image-builder:{version-eib} \
 build --definition-file downstream-cluster-config.yaml
----

This creates the output image file named `SLE-Micro-eib-output.raw`, based on the definition described above.

The output image must then be made available via a webserver, either the media-server container enabled via the <<metal3-media-server,Metal^3^ chart>>
or some other locally accessible server.  In the examples below, we refer to this server as `imagecache.local:8080`

=== Adding BareMetalHost inventory

Registering bare-metal servers for automated deployment requires creating two resources: a Secret storing
BMC access credentials and a Metal^3^ BareMetalHost resource defining the BMC connection and other details:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: controlplane-0-credentials
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=
---
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
kind: BareMetalHost
metadata:
  name: controlplane-0
  labels:
    cluster-role: control-plane
spec:
  online: true
  bootMACAddress: "00:f3:65:8a:a3:b0"
  bmc:
    address: redfish-virtualmedia://192.168.125.1:8000/redfish/v1/Systems/68bd0fb6-d124-4d17-a904-cdf33efe83ab
    disableCertificateVerification: true
    credentialsName: controlplane-0-credentials
----

Note the following:

* The Secret username/password must be base64 encoded. Note this should not include any trailing newlines (for example, use `echo -n`, not just `echo`!)
* The `cluster-role` label may be set now or later on cluster creation. In the example below, we expect `control-plane` or `worker`
* `bootMACAddress` must be a valid MAC that matches the control plane NIC of the host
* The `bmc` address is the connection to the BMC management API, the following are supported:
 ** `redfish-virtualmedia://<IP ADDRESS>/redfish/v1/Systems/<SYSTEM ID>`: Redfish virtual media, for example, SuperMicro
 ** `idrac-virtualmedia://<IP ADDRESS>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1`: Dell iDRAC
* See the https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/blob/main/docs/api.md[Upstream API docs] for more details on the BareMetalHost API


==== Configuring Static IPs

The BareMetalHost example above assumes DHCP provides the controlplane network configuration, but for scenarios where manual configuration
is needed such as static IPs it is possible to provide additional configuration, as described below.

[#metal3-add-network-eib]
===== Additional script for static network configuration

When creating the base image with Edge Image Builder, in the `network` folder, create the following `configure-network.sh` file.

This consumes configuration drive data on first-boot, and configures the host networking using the https://github.com/suse-edge/nm-configurator[NM Configurator tool].

[,shell]
----
#!/bin/bash

set -eux

# Attempt to statically configure a NIC in the case where we find a network_data.json
# In a configuration drive

CONFIG_DRIVE=$(blkid --label config-2 || true)
if [ -z "${CONFIG_DRIVE}" ]; then
  echo "No config-2 device found, skipping network configuration"
  exit 0
fi

mount -o ro $CONFIG_DRIVE /mnt

NETWORK_DATA_FILE="/mnt/openstack/latest/network_data.json"

if [ ! -f "${NETWORK_DATA_FILE}" ]; then
  umount /mnt
  echo "No network_data.json found, skipping network configuration"
  exit 0
fi

DESIRED_HOSTNAME=$(cat /mnt/openstack/latest/meta_data.json | tr ',{}' '\n' | grep '\"metal3-name\"' | sed 's/.*\"metal3-name\": \"\(.*\)\"/\1/')
echo "${DESIRED_HOSTNAME}" > /etc/hostname

mkdir -p /tmp/nmc/{desired,generated}
cp ${NETWORK_DATA_FILE} /tmp/nmc/desired/_all.yaml
umount /mnt

./nmc generate --config-dir /tmp/nmc/desired --output-dir /tmp/nmc/generated
./nmc apply --config-dir /tmp/nmc/generated
----

===== Additional secret with host network configuration

An additional secret containing data in the https://nmstate.io/[nmstate] format supported by <<components-nmc,NM Configurator>> can be defined for each host.

The secret is then referenced in the `BareMetalHost` resource via the `preprovisioningNetworkDataName` spec field.

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: controlplane-0-networkdata

      ipv4:
        address:
        - ip:  192.168.125.200
          prefix-length: 24

    routes:
      config:
      - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
        next-hop-address: 192.168.125.1
        next-hop-interface: enp1s0
---
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
kind: BareMetalHost
metadata:
  name: controlplane-0
  labels:
    cluster-role: control-plane
spec:
  preprovisioningNetworkDataName: controlplane-0-networkdata
# Remaining content as in previous example
----

NOTE: In some circumstances the MAC address may be omitted. See <<networking-unified>> for additional details.

==== BareMetalHost preparation

After creating the BareMetalHost resource and associated secrets as described above, a host preparation workflow is triggered:

* A ramdisk image is booted by virtualmedia attachment to the target host BMC
* The ramdisk inspects hardware details, and prepares the host for provisioning (for example by cleaning disks of previous data)
* On completion of this process, hardware details in the BareMetalHost `status.hardware` field are updated and can be verified

This process can take several minutes, but when completed you should see the BareMetalHost state become `available`:

[,bash]
----
% kubectl get baremetalhost
NAME             STATE       CONSUMER   ONLINE   ERROR   AGE
controlplane-0   available              true             9m44s
worker-0         available              true             9m44s
----

=== Creating downstream clusters

We now create Cluster API resources which define the downstream cluster, and Machine resources which will cause the BareMetalHost resources to
be provisioned, then bootstrapped to form an RKE2 cluster.

=== Control plane deployment

To deploy the controlplane we define a yaml manifest similar to the one below, which contains the following resources:

* Cluster resource defines the cluster name, networks, and type of controlplane/infrastructure provider (in this case RKE2/Metal3)
* Metal3Cluster defines the controlplane endpoint (host IP for single-node, LoadBalancer endpoint for multi-node, this example assumes single-node)
* RKE2ControlPlane defines the RKE2 version and any additional configuration needed during cluster bootstrapping
* Metal3MachineTemplate defines the OS Image to be applied to the BareMetalHost resources, and the hostSelector defines which BareMetalHosts to consume
* Metal3DataTemplate defines additional metaData to be passed to the BareMetalHost (note networkData is not currently supported in the Edge solution)

NOTE: For simplicity this example assumes a single-node control plane where the BareMetalHost is configured with an IP of `192.168.125.200`. For more advanced multi-node examples, please see <<atip-automated-provisioning>>.

=== Worker/Compute deployment

Similar to the control plane deployment, we define a YAML manifest which contains the following resources:

* MachineDeployment defines the number of replicas (hosts) and the bootstrap/infrastructure provider (in this case RKE2/Metal3)
* RKE2ConfigTemplate describes the RKE2 version and first-boot configuration for agent host bootstrapping
* Metal3MachineTemplate defines the OS Image to be applied to the BareMetalHost resources, and the host selector defines which BareMetalHosts to consume
* Metal3DataTemplate defines additional metadata to be passed to the BareMetalHost (note that `networkData` is not currently supported)

When the example above has been copied and adapted to suit your environment, it can be applied via `kubectl` then the cluster status can be monitored with `clusterctl`

[,bash]
----
% kubectl apply -f rke2-agent.yaml

# Wait for the worker nodes to be provisioned
% clusterctl describe cluster sample-cluster
NAME                                                    READY  SEVERITY  REASON  SINCE  MESSAGE

=== Cluster deprovisioning

The downstream cluster may be deprovisioned by deleting the resources applied in the creation steps above:

[,bash]
----
% kubectl delete -f rke2-agent.yaml
% kubectl delete -f rke2-control-plane.yaml
----

This triggers deprovisioning of the BareMetalHost resources, which may take several minutes, after which they should be in available state again:

[,bash]
----
% kubectl get bmh
NAME             STATE            CONSUMER                            ONLINE   ERROR   AGE
controlplane-0   deprovisioning   sample-cluster-controlplane-vlrt6   false            10m
worker-0         deprovisioning   sample-cluster-workers-785x5        false            10m

...

% kubectl get bmh
NAME             STATE       CONSUMER   ONLINE   ERROR   AGE
controlplane-0   available              false            15m
worker-0         available              false            15m

== Known issues

* The upstream https://github.com/metal3-io/ip-address-manager[IP Address Management controller] is currently not supported, because it's not yet compatible with our choice of network configuration tooling and first-boot toolchain in SLEMicro.
* Relatedly, the IPAM resources and Metal3DataTemplate networkData fields are not currently supported.
* Only deployment via redfish-virtualmedia is currently supported.

== Planned changes

* Enable support of the IPAM resources and configuration via networkData fields

== Additional resources

The <<atip, SUSE Edge for Telco Documentation>> has examples of more advanced usage of Metal^3^ for telco use-cases.

=== Single-node configuration

For test/PoC environments where the management cluster is a single node, it is possible to avoid the requirement for an additional floating IP managed via MetalLB.

In this mode, the endpoint for the management cluster APIs is the IP of the management cluster, therefore it should be reserved when using DHCP
or statically configured to ensure the management cluster IP does not change - referred to as `<MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_IP>` below.

To enable this scenario, the Metal^3^ chart values required are as follows:

[,yaml]
----
global:
  ironicIP: <MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_IP>
metal3-ironic:
  service:
    type: NodePort
----

=== Disabling TLS for virtualmedia ISO attachment

Some server vendors verify the SSL connection when attaching virtual-media ISO images to the BMC, which can cause a problem because the generated
certificates for the Metal^3^ deployment are self-signed, to work around this issue it's possible to disable TLS only for the virtualmedia disk attachment
with Metal^3^ chart values as follows:

[,yaml]
----
global:
  enable_vmedia_tls: false
----

An alternative solution is to configure the BMCs with the CA cert - in this case you can read the certificates from the cluster using `kubectl`:

[,bash]
----
kubectl get secret -n metal3-system ironic-vmedia-cert -o yaml
----

The certificate can then be configured on the server BMC console, although the process for that is vendor specific (and not possible for all
vendors, in which case the `enable_vmedia_tls` flag may be required).
