Five basic rules on how to write better technical documentation

== #1 Change perspective

____
Don't tell me how it works...tell me how to use it!
____

* Always put yourself into your reader`s shoes
** What knowledge level do I require readers to have?
** What does the reader want to achieve?
** What questions may the reader have?
** What can go wrong?
* Consider that your readers
** only have limited time
** are frustrated
** are under pressure
** work in a noisy environment
** are non-native speakers


[IMPORTANT]
====
More than 80% of our readers come via (Google) search and likely land at some random chapter in the book.
Make sure to always provide all required context and requirements at the beginning of a chapter.
====




== #2 Keep it Simple and Short (KISS)

Short and simple instructions are easier to understand and less error-prone.
This is not only relevant for readers, but also for localization.

Simple and clear language::
+
* utilize -> *use*
* indicate -> *show*, *tell*, *say*
* prerequisite -> *requirement*
+
No fillers::
+
* in order to -> *to*
* already existing -> *existing*
* completely new -> *new*
* simply do -> *do*
* please do -> *do*
+
Use present tense::
+
* Run xxx. The dialog yyy will appear. -> *Run xxx. The dialog yyy appears.*
+
One idea, one sentence::
+
Use YaST, which comes in two flavors (X Window UI, ncurses) to configure and manage the system and to install new software or security updates and patches.
+
->
+
*Use YaST to configure and manage the system.*
*Also use it to install new software and to keep your system up-to-date.*
*YaST comes with a UI to be used under X Window.*
*For the use in a terminal, an ncurses interface is available.*
+
Limit description of alternatives::
+
Usually there is more than one way to do things.
Limit the documentation to the _one_ recommended and supported way to do things.
Only document alternatives when absolutely required, for example UI and command-line.

== #3 Structure the Information

* Think of your document as a funnel: start with general information and become more specific the further you go
* place information where it matters
** goal and context comes first
** requirements go second
** procedure comes last
** warnings and notes need to be placed where relevant
** The above also applies to all sections of the document
* Always use ordered lists to describe a set of steps (procedure)
** no more than 10 steps per procedure (7+/- 2 is ideal); split into different tasks to shorten
** goal, steps, result
* Do not place any information in program listings
** ...because they will not be translated
* do not use headlines smaller than level 3 (`==== Level 3 headline`)
* break commands that are longer than 80 characters into multiple lines

== #4 Be consistent

Repetitions are _not_ bad::
+
. Run command XXX -> *Run command XXX*
. Execute command YYY -> *Run command YYY*
. Perform command ZZZ -> *Run command ZZZ*
+
Use consistent terminology::
+
* symbolic link, link, soft link, symlink -> *symbolic link*
* update vs upgrade
* add-on, addon, add on -> *add-on*

== #5 Avoid Interruptions

One line of thought::
+
They are, however, not marked as installed. -> *However, they are not marked as installed.*
+
Do not split verbs::
+
Shut the server down. -> *Shut down the server.*
