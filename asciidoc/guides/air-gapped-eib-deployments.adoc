== Intro

This guide will show how to deploy several of the SUSE Edge components completely air-gapped on SLE Micro 5.5 utilizing <<components-eib,Edge Image Builder(EIB)>>. With this, you'll be able to boot into a customized, ready to boot (CRB) image created by EIB and have the specified components deployed on either a RKE2 or K3s cluster without an Internet connection or any manual steps. This configuration is highly desirable for customers that want to pre-bake all artifacts required for deployment into their OS image, so they are immediately available on boot.

We will cover an air-gapped installation of:

* <<components-rancher>>
* <<components-neuvector>>
* <<components-longhorn>>
* <<components-kubevirt>>

[WARNING]
====
EIB will parse and pre-download all images referenced in the provided Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests. However, some of those may be attempting to pull container images and create Kubernetes resources based on those at runtime. In these cases we have to manually specify the necessary images in the definition file if we want to set up a completely air-gapped environment.
====

== Prerequisites

If you're following this guide, it's assumed that you are already familiar with <<components-eib,EIB>>. If not, please follow the <<quickstart-eib,quick start guide>> to better understand the concepts shown in practice below.

== Libvirt Network Configuration

[NOTE] 
====
To demo the air-gapped deployment, this guide will be done using a simulated air-gapped `libvirt` network and the following configuration will be tailored to that. For your own deployments, you may have to modify the `host1.local.yaml` configuration that will be introduced in the next step.
====

If you would like to use the same `libvirt` network configuration, follow along. If not, skip to <<config-dir-creation>>.

Let's create an isolated network configuration with an IP address range `192.168.100.2/24` for DHCP:

[,shell]
----
cat << EOF > isolatednetwork.xml
<network>
  <name>isolatednetwork</name>
  <bridge name='virbr1' stp='on' delay='0'/>
  <ip address='192.168.100.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
    <dhcp>
      <range start='192.168.100.2' end='192.168.100.254'/>
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
</network>
EOF
----

Now, the only thing left is to create the network and start it:

[,shell]
----
virsh net-define isolatednetwork.xml
virsh net-start isolatednetwork
----

== Base Directory Configuration [[config-dir-creation]]

The base directory configuration is the same across all different components, so we will set it up here.

We will first create the necessary subdirectories:

[,shell]
----
export CONFIG_DIR=$HOME/config
mkdir -p $CONFIG_DIR/base-images
mkdir -p $CONFIG_DIR/network
mkdir -p $CONFIG_DIR/kubernetes/helm/values
----

Make sure to add whichever base image you plan to use into the `base-images` directory. This guide will focus on the Self Install ISO found https://www.suse.com/download/sle-micro/[here].

Let's copy the downloaded image:

[,shell]
----
cp SLE-Micro.x86_64-5.5.0-Default-SelfInstall-GM2.install.iso $CONFIG_DIR/base-images/slemicro.iso
----

[NOTE]
=====
EIB is never going to modify the base image input.
=====

Let's create a file containing the desired network configuration:

[,shell]
----
cat << EOF > $CONFIG_DIR/network/host1.local.yaml
routes:
  config:
  - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
    metric: 100
    next-hop-address: 192.168.100.1
    next-hop-interface: eth0
    table-id: 254
  - destination: 192.168.100.0/24
    metric: 100
    next-hop-address:
    next-hop-interface: eth0
    table-id: 254
dns-resolver:
  config:
    server:
    - 192.168.100.1
    - 8.8.8.8
interfaces:
- name: eth0
  type: ethernet
  state: up
  mac-address: 34:8A:B1:4B:16:E7
  ipv4:
    address:
    - ip: 192.168.100.50
      prefix-length: 24
    dhcp: false
    enabled: true
  ipv6:
    enabled: false
EOF
----

This configuration ensures the following are present on the provisioned systems (using the specified MAC address):

* an Ethernet interface with a static IP address
* routing
* DNS
* hostname (`host1.local`)

The resulting file structure should now look like:
[,console]
----
├── kubernetes/
│   └── helm/
│       └── values/
├── base-images/
│   └── slemicro.iso
└── network/  
    └── host1.local.yaml
----

== Base Definition File

Edge Image Builder is using _definition files_ to modify the SLE Micro images. These files contain the majority of configurable options.
Many of these options will be repeated across the different component sections, so we will list and explain those here.

[TIP]
====
Full list of customization options in the definition file can be found in the https://github.com/suse-edge/edge-image-builder/blob/release-1.0/docs/building-images.md#image-definition-file[upstream documentation]
====

We will take a look at the following fields which will be present in all definition files:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0
image:
  imageType: iso
  arch: x86_64
  baseImage: slemicro.iso
  outputImageName: eib-image.iso
operatingSystem:
  users:
    - username: root
      encryptedPassword: $6$jHugJNNd3HElGsUZ$eodjVe4te5ps44SVcWshdfWizrP.xAyd71CVEXazBJ/.v799/WRCBXxfYmunlBO2yp1hm/zb4r8EmnrrNCF.P/
kubernetes:
  version: v1.28.10+rke2r1
embeddedArtifactRegistry:
  images:
    - ...
----

The `image` section is required, and it specifies the input image, its architecture and type, as well as what the output image will be called.

The `operatingSystem` section is optional, and contains configuration to enable login on the provisioned systems with the `root/eib` username/password.

The `kubernetes` section is optional, and it defines the Kubernetes type and version. We are going to use Kubernetes 1.28.10 and RKE2 by default.
Use `kubernetes.version: v1.28.10+k3s1` if K3s is desired instead. Unless explicitly configured via the `kubernetes.nodes` field, all clusters we bootstrap in this guide will be single-node ones.

The `embeddedArtifactRegistry` section will include all images which are only referenced and pulled at runtime for the specific component.

== Rancher Installation [[rancher-install]]

[NOTE]
====
The <<components-rancher,Rancher>> deployment that will be demonstrated will be highly slimmed down for demonstration purposes. For your actual deployments, additional artifacts may be necessary depending on your configuration.
====

The https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.8.5[Rancher v2.8.5] release assets contain a `rancher-images.txt` file which lists all the images required for an air-gapped installation.

There are about 602 container images in total which means that the resulting CRB image would be roughly 28GB+. For our Rancher installation, we will strip down that list to the smallest working configuration. From there, you can add back any images you may need for your deployments.

We will create the definition file and include the stripped down image list:

[,console]
----
apiVersion: 1.0

  imageType: iso
  arch: x86_64
  baseImage: slemicro.iso
  outputImageName: eib-image.iso

----

As compared to the full list of 602 container images, this slimmed down version only contains 62 which makes the new CRB image only about 7GB.

We also need to create a Helm values file for Rancher:
[,shell]
----
cat << EOF > $CONFIG_DIR/kubernetes/helm/values/rancher-values.yaml
hostname: 192.168.100.50.sslip.io
replicas: 1
bootstrapPassword: "adminadminadmin"
systemDefaultRegistry: registry.rancher.com
useBundledSystemChart: true
EOF
----

[WARNING]
====
Setting the `systemDefaultRegistry` to `registry.rancher.com` allows Rancher to automatically look for images in the embedded artifact registry started within the CRB image at boot. Omitting this field may result in failure to find the container images on the node.
====

Let's build the image:
[,shell]
----
podman run --rm -it --privileged -v $CONFIG_DIR:/eib \
registry.suse.com/edge/edge-image-builder:1.0.2 \
build --definition-file eib-iso-definition.yaml
----

The output should be similar to the following:

And when we go to `https://192.168.100.50.sslip.io` and log in with the `adminadminadmin` password that we set earlier, we are greeted with the Rancher dashboard:

image::air-gapped-rancher.png[]

== NeuVector Installation [[neuvector-install]]

Unlike the Rancher installation, the NeuVector installation does not require any special handling in EIB. EIB will automatically air-gap every image required by NeuVector.

We will create the definition file:

Let's build the image:

[,shell]
----
podman run --rm -it --privileged -v $CONFIG_DIR:/eib \
registry.suse.com/edge/edge-image-builder:1.0.2 \
build --definition-file eib-iso-definition.yaml
----

The output should be similar to the following:
[,console]

Once a node using the built image is provisioned, we can verify the installation of both KubeVirt and CDI.

Verify KubeVirt:

[,shell]
----
/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get all -n kubevirt-system --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml
----

The output should be similar to the following, showing that everything has been successfully deployed:
