This section explains how to generate updated SUSE Linux Micro images to be used with Edge Image Builder, with Cluster API (CAPI) + Metal^3^, or to write the disk image directly to a block device. This process is useful in situations where the latest patches are required to be included in the initial system boot images (to minimise patch transfer post-installation), or for scenarios where CAPI is used, where it's preferred to reinstall the operating system with a new image rather than upgrading the hosts in place.

This process makes use of https://osinside.github.io/kiwi/[Kiwi] to run the image build. SUSE Edge ships with a containerized version that simplifies the overall process with a helper utility baked in, allowing to specify the target *profile* required. The profile defines the type of output image that is required, with the common ones listed below:

* "*Base*" - A SUSE Linux Micro disk image with a reduced package set (it includes podman).
* "*Base-SelfInstall*" - A SelfInstall image based on the "Base" above.
* "*Base-RT*" - Same as "Base" above but using a real-time (rt) kernel instead.
* "*Base-RT-SelfInstall*" - A SelfInstall image based on the "Base-RT" above
* "*Default*" - A SUSE Linux Micro disk image based on the "Base" above but with a few more tools, including the virtualization stack, Cockpit and salt-minion.
* "*Default-SelfInstall*" - A SelfInstall image based on the "Default" above

See https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/{version-sl-micro}/html/Micro-deployment-images/index.html#alp-images-installer-type[SUSE Linux Micro {version-sl-micro}] documentation for more details.

This process works for both {x86-64} and {aarch64} architectures, although not all image profiles are available for both architectures, e.g. in SUSE Edge {version-edge-registry}, where SUSE Linux Micro {version-sl-micro} is used, a profile with a real-time kernel (i.e. "Base-RT" or "Base-RT-SelfInstall") is not currently available for {aarch64}.

NOTE: It is required to use a build host with the same architecture of the images being built. In other words, to build an {aarch64} image, it is required to use an {aarch64} build host, and vice-versa for {x86-64} - cross-builds are not supported at this time.

== Prerequisites

Kiwi image builder requires the following:

* A SUSE Linux Micro {version-sl-micro} host ("build system") with the same architecture of the image being built.
* The build system needs to be already registered via `SUSEConnect` (the registration is used to pull the latest packages from the SUSE repositories)
* An internet connection that can be used to pull the required packages. If connected via proxy, the build host needs to be pre-configured.
* SELinux needs to be disabled on the build host (as SELinux labelling takes place in the container and it can conflict with the host policy)
* At least 10GB free disk space to accommodate the container image, the build root, and the resulting output image(s)

== Getting Started

Due to certain limitations, it is currently required to disable SELinux. Connect to the SUSE Linux Micro {version-sl-micro} image build host and ensure SELinux is disabled:

[,console]
----
# setenforce 0
----

Create an output directory to be shared with the Kiwi build container to save the resulting images:

[,console]
----
# mkdir ~/output
----

Pull the latest Kiwi builder image from the SUSE Registry:

[,console,subs="attributes"]
----
# podman pull registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/kiwi-builder:{version-kiwi-builder}
(...)
----

== Building the Default Image

This is the default behavior of the Kiwi image container if no arguments are provided during the container image run. The following command runs `podman` with two directories mapped to the container:

* The `/etc/zypp/repos.d` SUSE Linux Micro package repository directory from the underlying host.
* The output `~/output` directory created above.

The Kiwi image container requires to run the `build-image` helper script as:

[,console,subs="attributes"]
----
# podman run --privileged -v /etc/zypp/repos.d:/micro-sdk/repos/ -v ~/output:/tmp/output \
    -it registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/kiwi-builder:{version-kiwi-builder} build-image
(...)
----

NOTE: It's expected that if you're running this script for the first time that it will *fail* shortly after starting with "*ERROR: Early loop device test failed, please retry the container run.*", this is a symptom of loop devices being created on the underlying host system that are not immediately visible inside of the container image. Simply re-run the command again and it should proceed without issue.

After a few minutes the images can be found in the local output directory:

[,console,subs="attributes"]
----
(...)
INFO: Image build successful, generated images are available in the 'output' directory.

# ls -1 output/
SLE-Micro.x86_64-{version-sl-micro}.changes
SLE-Micro.x86_64-{version-sl-micro}.packages
SLE-Micro.x86_64-{version-sl-micro}.raw
SLE-Micro.x86_64-{version-sl-micro}.verified
build
kiwi.result
kiwi.result.json
----

== Building images with other profiles

In order to build different image profiles, the "*-p*" command option in the Kiwi container image helper script is used. For example, to build the "*Default-SelfInstall*" ISO image:

[,console,subs="attributes"]
----
# podman run --privileged -v /etc/zypp/repos.d:/micro-sdk/repos/ -v ~/output:/tmp/output \
    -it registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/kiwi-builder:{version-kiwi-builder} build-image -p Default-SelfInstall
(...)
----

NOTE: To avoid data loss, Kiwi will refuse to run if there are images in the `output` directory. It is required to remove the contents of the output directory before proceeding with `rm -f output/*`. 

Alternatively, to build a SelfInstall ISO image with the RealTime kernel ("*kernel-rt*"):

[,console,subs="attributes"]
----
# podman run --privileged -v /etc/zypp/repos.d:/micro-sdk/repos/ -v ~/output:/tmp/output \
    -it registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/kiwi-builder:{version-kiwi-builder} build-image -p Base-RT-SelfInstall
(...)
----

== Building images with large sector sizes

Some hardware requires an image with a large sector size, i.e. *4096 bytes* rather than the standard 512 bytes. The containerized Kiwi builder supports the ability to generate images with large block size by specifying the "*-b*" parameter. For example, to build a "*Default-SelfInstall*" image with a large sector size:

[,console,subs="attributes"]
----
# podman run --privileged -v /etc/zypp/repos.d:/micro-sdk/repos/ -v ~/output:/tmp/output \
    -it registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/kiwi-builder:{version-kiwi-builder} build-image -p Default-SelfInstall -b
(...)
----

== Using a custom Kiwi image definition file

For advanced use-cases a custom Kiwi image definition file (`SL-Micro.kiwi`) can be used along with any necessary post-build scripts. This requires overriding the default definitions pre-packaged by the SUSE Edge team.

Create a new directory and map it into the container image where the helper script is looking (`/micro-sdk/defs`):

[,console,subs="attributes"]
----
# mkdir ~/mydefs/
# cp /path/to/SL-Micro.kiwi ~/mydefs/
# cp /path/to/config.sh ~/mydefs/
# podman run --privileged -v /etc/zypp/repos.d:/micro-sdk/repos/ -v ~/output:/tmp/output -v ~/mydefs/:/micro-sdk/defs/ \
    -it registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/kiwi-builder:{version-kiwi-builder} build-image
(...)
----

[WARNING]
====
This is only required for advanced use-cases and may cause supportability issues. Please contact your SUSE representative for further advice and guidance.
====

To get the default Kiwi image definition files included in the container, the following commands can be used:

[,console,subs="attributes"]
----
$ podman create --name kiwi-builder registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/kiwi-builder:{version-kiwi-builder}
$ podman cp kiwi-builder:/micro-sdk/defs/SL-Micro.kiwi .
$ podman cp kiwi-builder:/micro-sdk/defs/SL-Micro.kiwi.4096 .
$ podman rm kiwi-builder
$ ls ./SL-Micro.*
(...)
