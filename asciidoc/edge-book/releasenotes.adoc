SUSE Edge 3.1 is a tightly integrated and comprehensively validated end-to-end solution for addressing the unique challenges of the deployment of infrastructure and cloud-native applications at the edge. Its driving focus is to provide an opinionated, yet highly flexible, highly scalable, and secure platform that spans initial deployment image building, node provisioning and onboarding, application deployment, observability, and lifecycle management.

The solution is designed with the notion that there is no "one-size-fits-all" edge platform due to our customers’ widely varying requirements and expectations. Edge deployments push us to solve, and continually evolve, some of the most challenging problems, including massive scalability, restricted network availability, physical space constraints, new security threats and attack vectors, variations in hardware architecture and system resources, the requirement to deploy and interface with legacy infrastructure and applications, and customer solutions that have extended lifespans.

SUSE Edge is built on best-of-breed open source software from the ground up, consistent with both our 30-year history in delivering secure, stable, and certified SUSE Linux platforms and our experience in providing highly scalable and feature-rich Kubernetes management with our Rancher portfolio. SUSE Edge builds on-top of these capabilities to deliver functionality that can address a wide number of market segments, including retail, medical, transportation, logistics, telecommunications, smart manufacturing, and Industrial IoT.

NOTE: SUSE Adaptive Telco Infrastructure Platform (ATIP) is a derivative (or downstream product) of SUSE Edge, with additional optimizations and components that enable the platform to address the requirements found in telecommunications use-cases. Unless explicitly stated, all the release notes are applicable for both SUSE Edge 3.1, and SUSE ATIP 3.1.

= About

These Release Notes are, unless explicitly specified and explained, identical across all architectures, and the most recent version, along with the release notes of all other SUSE products are always available online at https://www.suse.com/releasenotes[https://www.suse.com/releasenotes].

Entries are only listed once, but they can be referenced in several places if they are important and belong to more than one section. Release notes usually only list changes that happened between two subsequent releases. Certain important entries from the release notes of previous product versions may be repeated. To make these entries easier to identify, they contain a note to that effect.

However, repeated entries are provided as a courtesy only. Therefore, if you are skipping one or releases, check the release notes of the skipped releases also. If you are only reading the release notes of the current release, you could miss important changes that may affect system behavior. SUSE Edge versions are defined as x.y.z, where 'x' denotes the major version, 'y' denotes the minor, and 'z' denotes the patch version, also known as the "z-stream". SUSE Edge product lifecycles are defined based around a given minor release, e.g. "3.1", but ship with subsequent patch updates through its lifecycle, e.g. "3.1.2".

NOTE: SUSE Edge z-stream releases are tightly integrated and thoroughly tested as a versioned stack. Upgrade of any individual components to a different versions to those listed above is likely to result in system downtime. While it's possible to run Edge clusters in untested configurations, it is not recommended, and it may take longer to provide resolution through the support channels.

= Release 3.1.2

Availability Date: 14th May 2025

Summary: SUSE Edge 3.1.2 is the second release z-stream in the SUSE Edge 3.1 release stream.

== New Features

* Updated to Kubernetes 1.30.11, and Rancher Prime 2.9.9
* Updated to SUSE Security (Neuvector) 5.4.2
* Updated to SUSE Storage (Longhorn) 1.7.3

== Bug & Security Fixes

* Addresses https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1974[CVE-2025-1974] with patches for ingress-nginx in RKE2. More information available https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/24/ingress-nginx-cve-2025-1974/[here].
* SUSE Storage (Longhorn) 1.7.3 contains several bugfixes, including
** Fix volume FailedMount issue which can cause volume attachment to fail https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9939[Upstream Longhorn Issue]
** Fix engine stuck in stopped state issue which can prevent volume attachment https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/issues/9938[Upstream Longhorn Issue]
* The Kiwi Builder has been added, version 10.2.12 to match recent security changes in Kiwi, shifting from https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi/commit/d4d39e481aaff8be28337a9c76c3913a8a482628[md5 to sha256 checksum methods] for image verification.
* The Edge Image Builder image has been rebuilt to address the Kiwi changes mentioned above.

== Known Issues

* When updating to RKE2 1.30.11, which resolves https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1974[CVE-2025-1974], SUSE Linux Micro 6.0 *must* be updated to include kernel `>=6.4.0-26-default` or `>=6.4.0-30-rt` (real-time kernel) due to required SELinux kernel patches. If not applied, the ingress-nginx pod will remain in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state. To apply the kernel update run `transactional-update` on the host itself (to update all packages), or `transactional-update pkg update kernel-default` (or kernel-rt) to update just the kernel, then reboot the host. If deploying new clusters, please follow <<guides-kiwi-builder-images>> to build fresh images containing the latest kernel.
* A bug with Kubernetes Job Controller has been identified that on certain conditions it can cause the RKE2/K3s nodes to stay in `NotReady` state (see the https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/8357[#8357 RKE2 issue]). The errors can look like:

[,bash]
----
E0605 23:11:18.489721   	1 job_controller.go:631] "Unhandled Error" err="syncing job: tracking status: adding uncounted pods to status: Operation cannot be fulfilled on jobs.batch \"helm-install-rke2-ingress-nginx\": StorageError: invalid object, Code: 4, Key: /registry/jobs/kube-system/helm-install-rke2-ingress-nginx, ResourceVersion: 0, AdditionalErrorMsg: Precondition failed: UID in precondition: 0aa6a781-7757-4c61-881a-cb1a4e47802c, UID in object meta: 6a320146-16b8-4f83-88c5-fc8b5a59a581" logger="UnhandledError"
----

As a workaround, the `kube-controller-manager` pod can be restarted with `crictl` as:

[,bash]
----
export CONTAINER_RUNTIME_ENDPOINT=unix:///run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock
export KUBEMANAGER_POD=$(/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/crictl ps --label io.kubernetes.container.name=kube-controller-manager --quiet)
/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/crictl stop ${KUBEMANAGER_POD} && \
/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/crictl rm ${KUBEMANAGER_POD}
----

* On RKE2/K3s 1.31 and 1.32 versions, the directory `/etc/cni` being used to store CNI configurations may not trigger a notification of the files being written there to `containerd` due to certain conditions related to `overlayfs` (see the https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/8356[#8356 RKE2 issue]). This in turn results in the deployment of RKE2/K3s to get stuck waiting for the CNI to start, and the RKE2/K3s nodes to stay in `NotReady` state. This can be seen at node level with `kubectl describe node <affected_node>`:

[,bash]
----
​​Conditions:

----

As a workaround, a tmpfs volume can be mounted at the `/etc/cni` directory before RKE2 starts. It avoids the usage of overlayfs which results in containerd missing notifications and the configs should get rewritten every time the node is restarted and the pods initcontainers run again. If using EIB, this can be a `04-tmpfs-cni.sh` script in the `custom/scripts` directory (as explained here[https://github.com/suse-edge/edge-image-builder/blob/release-1.2/docs/building-images.md#custom]) that looks like:

[,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p /etc/cni
mount -t tmpfs -o mode=0700,size=5M tmpfs /etc/cni
echo "tmpfs /etc/cni tmpfs defaults,size=5M,mode=0700 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

* The RKE2 CAPI provider is updated to resolve an issue where ETCD becomes unavailable on update: https://github.com/rancher/cluster-api-provider-rke2/issues/449[RKE2 provider issue #449]

== Known issues
* A bug with Kubernetes Job Controller has been identified that on certain conditions it can cause the RKE2/K3s nodes to stay in `NotReady` state (see the https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/8357[#8357 RKE2 issue]). The errors can look like:

[,bash]
----
E0605 23:11:18.489721   	1 job_controller.go:631] "Unhandled Error" err="syncing job: tracking status: adding uncounted pods to status: Operation cannot be fulfilled on jobs.batch \"helm-install-rke2-ingress-nginx\": StorageError: invalid object, Code: 4, Key: /registry/jobs/kube-system/helm-install-rke2-ingress-nginx, ResourceVersion: 0, AdditionalErrorMsg: Precondition failed: UID in precondition: 0aa6a781-7757-4c61-881a-cb1a4e47802c, UID in object meta: 6a320146-16b8-4f83-88c5-fc8b5a59a581" logger="UnhandledError"
----

As a workaround, the `kube-controller-manager` pod can be restarted with `crictl` as:

[,bash]
----
export CONTAINER_RUNTIME_ENDPOINT=unix:///run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock
export KUBEMANAGER_POD=$(/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/crictl ps --label io.kubernetes.container.name=kube-controller-manager --quiet)
/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/crictl stop ${KUBEMANAGER_POD} && \
/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/crictl rm ${KUBEMANAGER_POD}
----

* On RKE2/K3s 1.31 and 1.32 versions, the directory `/etc/cni` being used to store CNI configurations may not trigger a notification of the files being written there to `containerd` due to certain conditions related to `overlayfs` (see the https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/8356[#8356 RKE2 issue]). This in turn results in the deployment of RKE2/K3s to get stuck waiting for the CNI to start, and the RKE2/K3s nodes to stay in `NotReady` state. This can be seen at node level with `kubectl describe node <affected_node>`:

----

As a workaround, a tmpfs volume can be mounted at the `/etc/cni` directory before RKE2 starts. It avoids the usage of overlayfs which results in containerd missing notifications and the configs should get rewritten every time the node is restarted and the pods initcontainers run again. If using EIB, this can be a `04-tmpfs-cni.sh` script in the `custom/scripts` directory (as explained here[https://github.com/suse-edge/edge-image-builder/blob/release-1.2/docs/building-images.md#custom]) that looks like:

** Large Helm manifests fail to install: https://github.com/suse-edge/edge-image-builder/issues/491[EIB issue #491]

== Known issues
* A bug with Kubernetes Job Controller has been identified that on certain conditions it can cause the RKE2/K3s nodes to stay in `NotReady` state (see the https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/8357[#8357 RKE2 issue]). The errors can look like:

[,bash]
----
E0605 23:11:18.489721   	1 job_controller.go:631] "Unhandled Error" err="syncing job: tracking status: adding uncounted pods to status: Operation cannot be fulfilled on jobs.batch \"helm-install-rke2-ingress-nginx\": StorageError: invalid object, Code: 4, Key: /registry/jobs/kube-system/helm-install-rke2-ingress-nginx, ResourceVersion: 0, AdditionalErrorMsg: Precondition failed: UID in precondition: 0aa6a781-7757-4c61-881a-cb1a4e47802c, UID in object meta: 6a320146-16b8-4f83-88c5-fc8b5a59a581" logger="UnhandledError"
----

As a workaround, the `kube-controller-manager` pod can be restarted with `crictl` as:

[,bash]
----
export CONTAINER_RUNTIME_ENDPOINT=unix:///run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock
export KUBEMANAGER_POD=$(/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/crictl ps --label io.kubernetes.container.name=kube-controller-manager --quiet)
/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/crictl stop ${KUBEMANAGER_POD} && \
/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/crictl rm ${KUBEMANAGER_POD}
----

* On RKE2/K3s 1.31 and 1.32 versions, the directory `/etc/cni` being used to store CNI configurations may not trigger a notification of the files being written there to `containerd` due to certain conditions related to `overlayfs` (see the https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/8356[#8356 RKE2 issue]). This in turn results in the deployment of RKE2/K3s to get stuck waiting for the CNI to start, and the RKE2/K3s nodes to stay in `NotReady` state. This can be seen at node level with `kubectl describe node <affected_node>`:

[,bash]
----
​​Conditions:
  Type         	Status  LastHeartbeatTime             	LastTransitionTime            	Reason                   	Message
  ----         	------  -----------------             	------------------            	------                   	-------
  Ready        	False   Thu, 05 Jun 2025 17:41:28 +0000   Thu, 05 Jun 2025 14:38:16 +0000   KubeletNotReady          	container runtime network not ready: NetworkReady=false reason:NetworkPluginNotReady message:Network plugin returns error: cni plugin not initialized
----

As a workaround, a tmpfs volume can be mounted at the `/etc/cni` directory before RKE2 starts. It avoids the usage of overlayfs which results in containerd missing notifications and the configs should get rewritten every time the node is restarted and the pods initcontainers run again. If using EIB, this can be a `04-tmpfs-cni.sh` script in the `custom/scripts` directory (as explained here[https://github.com/suse-edge/edge-image-builder/blob/release-1.2/docs/building-images.md#custom]) that looks like:

[,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p /etc/cni
mount -t tmpfs -o mode=0700,size=5M tmpfs /etc/cni
echo "tmpfs /etc/cni tmpfs defaults,size=5M,mode=0700 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

[,bash]
----
include::key.sh[]
----

Verify the container image hash, for example using `crane`:

[,bash]
----
> crane digest registry.suse.com/edge/3.1/baremetal-operator:0.6.1
sha256:cacd1496f59c47475f3cfc9774e647ef08ca0aa1c1e4a48e067901cf7635af8a
----

Verify with `cosign`:

[,bash]
----
> cosign verify-attestation --type spdxjson --key key.pem registry.suse.com/edge/3.1/baremetal-operator@sha256:cacd1496f59c47475f3cfc9774e647ef08ca0aa1c1e4a48e067901cf7635af8a > /dev/null

= Upgrade Steps

Refer to the <<day-2-operations>> for details around how to upgrade to a new release.

Below are some technical considerations to be aware of when upgrading from Edge 3.0:

== SSH root login on SUSE Linux Micro 6.0

In SUSE Linux Micro 5.5 it was possible to SSH as root using password-based authentication, but SUSE Linux Micro 6.0 only key-based authentication is allowed by default.

Systems upgraded to 6.0 from 5.x carry over the old behavior. New installations will enforce the new behavior.

It is recommended to create a non-root user or use key based authentication, but if necessary installing the package `openssh-server-config-rootlogin` restores the old behavior and allows password-based login for the root user.

= Known Limitations

Unless otherwise stated these apply to the 3.1.0 release and all subsequent z-stream versions.

* Akri is a Technology Preview offering, and is not subject to the standard scope of support.
* Edge Image Builder on aarch64 is a Technology Preview offering, and is not subject to the standard scope of support.

= Product Support Lifecycle

SUSE Edge is backed by award-winning support from SUSE, an established technology leader with a proven history of delivering enterprise-quality support services. For more information, see https://www.suse.com/lifecycle[https://www.suse.com/lifecycle] and the Support Policy page at https://www.suse.com/support/policy.html[https://www.suse.com/support/policy.html]. If you have any questions about raising a support case, how SUSE classifies severity levels, or the scope of support, please see the Technical Support Handbook at https://www.suse.com/support/handbook/[https://www.suse.com/support/handbook/].

SUSE Edge "3.1" is supported for 24-months of production support, with an initial 6-months of "full support", followed by 18-months of "maintenance support". In the "full support" coverage period, SUSE may introduce new features (that do not break existing functionality), introduce bug fixes, and deliver security patches. During the "maintenance support" window, only critical security and bug fixes will be introduced, with other fixes delivered at our discretion.

Unless explicitly stated, all components listed are considered Generally Available (GA), and are covered by SUSE's standard scope of support. Some components may be listed as "Technology Preview", where SUSE is providing customers with access to early pre-GA features and functionality for evaluation, but are not subject to the standard support policies and are not recommended for production use-cases. SUSE very much welcomes feedback and suggestions on the improvements that can be made to Technology Preview components, but SUSE reserves the right to deprecate a Technology Preview feature before it becomes Generally Available if it doesn't meet the needs of our customers or doesn't reach a state of maturity that we require.

Please note that SUSE must occasionally deprecate features or change API specifications. Reasons for feature deprecation or API change could include a feature being updated or replaced by a new implementation, a new feature set, upstream technology is no longer available, or the upstream community has introduced incompatible changes. It is not intended that this will ever happen within a given minor release (x.z), and so all z-stream releases will maintain API compatibility and feature functionality. SUSE will endeavor to provide deprecation warnings with plenty of notice within the release notes, along with workarounds, suggestions, and mitigations to minimize service disruption.

The SUSE Edge team also welcomes community feedback, where issues can be raised within the respective code repository within https://www.github.com/suse-edge[https://www.github.com/suse-edge].
