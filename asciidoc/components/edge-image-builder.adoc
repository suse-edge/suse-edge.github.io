Edge Image Builder (EIB) is a tool that streamlines the generation of Customized, Ready-to-Boot (CRB) disk images for bootstrapping machines. These images enable the end-to-end deployment of the entire SUSE software stack with a single image.

Whilst EIB can create CRB images for all provisioning scenarios, EIB demonstrates a tremendous value in air-gapped deployments with limited or completely isolated networks.


== How does SUSE Edge use Edge Image Builder?

SUSE Edge uses EIB for the simplified and quick configuration of customized SUSE Linux Micro images for a variety of scenarios. These scenarios include the bootstrapping of virtual and bare-metal machines with:

* Fully air-gapped deployments of K3s/RKE2 Kubernetes (single & multi-node)
* Fully air-gapped Helm chart and Kubernetes manifest deployments
* Registration to Rancher via Elemental API
* Metal^3^
* Customized networking (for example, static IP, host name, VLAN's, bonding, etc.)
* Customized operating system configurations (for example, users, groups, passwords, SSH keys, proxies, NTP, custom SSL certificates, etc.)
* Air-gapped installation of host-level and side-loaded RPM packages (including dependency resolution)
* Registration to SUSE Multi-Linux Manager for OS management
* Embedded container images
* Kernel command-line arguments
* Systemd units to be enabled/disabled at boot time
* Custom scripts and files for any manual tasks

== Getting started

Comprehensive documentation for the usage and testing of Edge Image Builder can be found {link-eib-docs}[here].

Additionally, see <<quickstart-eib>> covering a basic deployment scenario.

Once you are familiar with this tool, please find some more useful information on our link:../tips/eib.adoc[Tips and tricks] page.

== Known issues

* EIB air-gaps Helm charts through templating the Helm charts and parsing all the images within the template. If a Helm chart does not keep all of its images within the template and instead side-loads the images, EIB will not be able to air-gap those images automatically. The solution to this is to manually add any undetected images to the `embeddedArtifactRegistry` section of the definition file.
