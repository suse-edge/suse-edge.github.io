Akri is a CNCF-Sandbox project that aims to discover leaf devices to present those as Kubernetes native resource.
It also allows scheduling a pod or a job for each discovered device.
Devices can be node-local or networked, and can use a wide variety of protocols.

Akri's upstream documentation is available at: https://docs.akri.sh

== How does SUSE Edge use Akri?

[WARNING]
Akri is currently tech-preview in the SUSE Edge stack.

Akri is available as part of the Edge Stack whenever there is a need to discover and schedule workload against leaf devices.

== Installing Akri
Akri is available as a Helm chart within the Edge Helm repository.
The recommended way of configuring Akri is by using the given Helm chart to deploy the different components (agent, controller, discovery-handlers), and then use your preferred deployment mechanism to deploy Akri's Configuration CRDs.

== Configuring Akri
Akri is configured using a `akri.sh/Configuration` object, this object takes in all information about how to discover the devices, as well as what to do when a matching one is discovered.

Here is an example configuration breakdown with all fields explained:
[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: akri.sh/v0
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: sample-configuration
spec:
----

This part describes the configuration of the discovery handler, you have to specify its name (the handlers available as part of Akri's chart are `udev`, `opcua`, `onvif`).
The `discoveryDetails` is handler specific, refer to the handler's documentation on how to configure it.
[,yaml]
----
  discoveryHandler:
    name: debugEcho
    discoveryDetails: |+
      descriptions:
        - "foo"
        - "bar"
----
This section defines the workload to be deployed for every discovered device.
The example shows a minimal version of a `Pod` configuration in `brokerPodSpec`, all usual fields of a Pod's spec can be used here.
It also shows the Akri specific syntax to request the device in the `resources` section.

You can alternatively use a Job instead of a Pod, using the `brokerJobSpec` key instead, and providing the spec part of a Job to it.
[,yaml]
----
  brokerSpec:
    brokerPodSpec:
      containers:
      - name: broker-container
        image: rancher/hello-world
        resources:
          requests:
            "{{PLACEHOLDER}}" : "1"
          limits:
            "{{PLACEHOLDER}}" : "1"
----
These two sections show how to configure Akri to deploy a service per broker (`instanceService`), or pointing to all brokers (`configurationService`).
These are containing all elements pertaining to a usual Service.
[,yaml]
----
  instanceServiceSpec:
    type: ClusterIp
    ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      protocol: tcp
      targetPort: 80
  configurationServiceSpec:
    type: ClusterIp
    ports:
    - name: https
      port: 443
      protocol: tcp
      targetPort: 443
----

The `brokerProperties` field is a key/value store that will be exposed as additional environment variables to any pod requesting a discovered device.

The capacity is the allowed number of concurrent users of a discovered device.
[,yaml]
----
  brokerProperties:
    key: value
  capacity: 1
----

== Writing and deploying additional Discovery Handlers

In case the protocol used by your device isn't covered by an existing discovery handler, you can write your own using the https://docs.akri.sh/development/handler-development[handler development guide].

[#akri-dashboard-extension-usage]
== Akri Rancher Dashboard Extension

Akri Dashboard Extension allows you to use Rancher Dashboard user interface to manage and monitor leaf devices and run workloads once these devices are discovered.

See <<components-rancher-dashboard-extensions>> for installation guidance.

Once the extension is installed you can navigate to any Akri-enabled managed cluster using cluster explorer. Under *Akri* navigation group you can see *Configurations* and *Instances* sections.

image::akri-extension-configurations.png[]

The configurations list provides information about `Configuration Discovery Handler` and number of instances. Clicking the name opens a configuration detail page.

image::akri-extension-configuration-detail.png[]

You can also edit or create a new *Configuration*. The extension allows you to select discovery handler, set up broker pod or job, customize configurations and instance services, and set the configuration capacity.

image::akri-extension-configuration-edit.png[]

Discovered devices are listed in the *Instances* list.

image::akri-extension-instances-list.png[]

Clicking the *Instance* name opens a detail page allowing to view the workloads and instance service.
