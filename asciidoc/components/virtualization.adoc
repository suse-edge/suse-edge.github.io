This section describes how you can use Edge Virtualization to run virtual machines on your edge nodes. Edge Virtualization is designed for lightweight virtualization use-cases, where it is expected that a common workflow for the deployment and management of both virtualized and containerized applications will be utilized.

SUSE Edge Virtualization supports two methods of running virtual machines:

1. Deploying the virtual machines manually via libvirt+qemu-kvm at the host level (where Kubernetes is not involved)
2. Deploying the KubeVirt operator for Kubernetes-based management of virtual machines

Both options are valid, but only the second one is covered below. If you want to use the standard out-of-the box virtualization mechanisms provided by SUSE Linux Micro, a comprehensive guide can be found https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/chap-virtualization-introduction.html[here], and whilst it was primarily written for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, the concepts are almost identical.

This guide initially explains how to deploy the additional virtualization components onto a system that has already been pre-deployed, but follows with a section that describes how to embed this configuration in the initial deployment via Edge Image Builder. If you do not want to run through the basics and set things up manually, skip right ahead to that section.

== KubeVirt overview

KubeVirt allows for managing Virtual Machines with Kubernetes alongside the rest of your containerized workloads. It does this by running the user space portion of the Linux virtualization stack in a container. This minimizes the requirements on the host system, allowing for easier setup and management. 

[Note]
====
Details about KubeVirt's architecture can be found in link:https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/architecture/[the upstream documentation.]
====

== Prerequisites

If you are following this guide, we assume you have the following already available:

* At least one physical host with SUSE Linux Micro {version-operatingsystem} installed, and with virtualization extensions enabled in the BIOS (see {link-virtualization-sles}[here] for details).
* Across your nodes, a K3s/RKE2 Kubernetes cluster already deployed and with an appropriate `kubeconfig` that enables superuser access to the cluster.
* Access to the root user â€” these instructions assume you are the root user, and _not_ escalating your privileges via `sudo`.
* You have https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm] available locally with an adequate network connection to be able to push configurations to your Kubernetes cluster and download the required images.

== Manual installation of Edge Virtualization

This guide will not walk you through the deployment of Kubernetes, but it assumes that you have either installed the SUSE Edge-appropriate version of https://k3s.io/[K3s] or https://docs.rke2.io/install/quickstart[RKE2] and that you have your kubeconfig configured accordingly so that standard `kubectl` commands can be executed as the superuser. We assume your node forms a single-node cluster, although there are no significant differences expected for multi-node deployments.

SUSE Edge Virtualization is deployed via three separate Helm charts, specifically:

* *KubeVirt*: The core virtualization components, that is, Kubernetes CRDs, operators and other components required for enabling Kubernetes to deploy and manage virtual machines.
* *KubeVirt Dashboard Extension*: An optional Rancher UI extension that allows basic virtual machine management, for example, starting/stopping of virtual machines as well as accessing the console.
* *Containerized Data Importer (CDI)*: An additional component that enables persistent-storage integration for KubeVirt, providing capabilities for virtual machines to use existing Kubernetes storage back-ends for data, but also allowing users to import or clone data volumes for virtual machines.

Each of these Helm charts is versioned according to the SUSE Edge release you are currently using. For production/supported usage, employ the artifacts that can be found in the SUSE Registry.

First, ensure that your `kubectl` access is working:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl get nodes
----

This should show something similar to the following:

[,shell]
----
NAME                   STATUS   ROLES                       AGE     VERSION
node1.edge.rdo.wales   Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   4h20m   v1.30.5+rke2r1
node2.edge.rdo.wales   Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   4h15m   v1.30.5+rke2r1
node3.edge.rdo.wales   Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   4h15m   v1.30.5+rke2r1
----

Now you can proceed to install the *KubeVirt* and *Containerized Data Importer (CDI)* Helm charts:

[,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
$ helm install kubevirt oci://registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/kubevirt-chart --namespace kubevirt-system --create-namespace
$ helm install cdi oci://registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/cdi-chart --namespace cdi-system --create-namespace
----

In a few minutes, you should have all KubeVirt and CDI components deployed. You can validate this by checking all the deployed resources in the `kubevirt-system` and `cdi-system` namespace.

Verify KubeVirt resources:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl get all -n kubevirt-system
----

This should show something similar to the following:

To verify that the `VirtualMachine` custom resource definitions (CRDs) are deployed, you can validate with:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl explain virtualmachine
----

This should print out the definition of the `VirtualMachine` object, which should print as follows:

[,shell]
----
GROUP:      kubevirt.io
KIND:       VirtualMachine
VERSION:    v1

DESCRIPTION:
    VirtualMachine handles the VirtualMachines that are not running or are in a
    stopped state The VirtualMachine contains the template to create the
    VirtualMachineInstance. It also mirrors the running state of the created
    VirtualMachineInstance in its status.
(snip)
----

== Deploying virtual machines

Now that KubeVirt and CDI are deployed, let us define a simple virtual machine based on https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/[openSUSE Tumbleweed]. This virtual machine has the most simple of configurations, using standard "pod networking" for a networking configuration identical to any other pod. It also employs non-persistent storage, ensuring the storage is ephemeral, just like in any container that does not have a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/[PVC].

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: tumbleweed
  namespace: default
spec:
  runStrategy: Always
  template:
    spec:

        devices: {}
        machine:

          guest: 2Gi
        resources: {}
      volumes:
      - containerDisk:
          image: registry.opensuse.org/home/roxenham/tumbleweed-container-disk/containerfile/cloud-image:latest
        name: tumbleweed-containerdisk-0
      - cloudInitNoCloud:
          userDataBase64: I2Nsb3VkLWNvbmZpZwpkaXNhYmxlX3Jvb3Q6IGZhbHNlCnNzaF9wd2F1dGg6IFRydWUKdXNlcnM6CiAgLSBkZWZhdWx0CiAgLSBuYW1lOiBzdXNlCiAgICBncm91cHM6IHN1ZG8KICAgIHNoZWxsOiAvYmluL2Jhc2gKICAgIHN1ZG86ICBBTEw9KEFMTCkgTk9QQVNTV0Q6QUxMCiAgICBsb2NrX3Bhc3N3ZDogRmFsc2UKICAgIHBsYWluX3RleHRfcGFzc3dkOiAnc3VzZScK
        name: cloudinitdisk
EOF
----

This should print that a `VirtualMachine` was created:

[,shell]
----
virtualmachine.kubevirt.io/tumbleweed created
----

This `VirtualMachine` definition is minimal, specifying little about the configuration. It simply outlines that it is a machine type "https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/Q35[q35]" with 2 GB of memory that uses a disk image based on an ephemeral `https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/virtual_machines/disks_and_volumes/#containerdisk[containerDisk]` (that is, a disk image that is stored in a container image from a remote image repository), and specifies a base64 encoded cloudInit disk, which we only use for user creation and password enforcement at boot time (use `base64 -d` to decode it).

> NOTE: This virtual machine image is only for testing. The image is not officially supported and is only meant as a documentation example.

This machine takes a few minutes to boot as it needs to download the openSUSE Tumbleweed disk image, but once it has done so, you can view further details about the virtual machine by checking the virtual machine information:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl get vmi
----

This should print the node that the virtual machine was started on, and the IP address of the virtual machine. Remember, since it uses pod networking, the reported IP address will be just like any other pod, and routable as such:

[,shell]
----
NAME         AGE     PHASE     IP           NODENAME               READY
tumbleweed   4m24s   Running   10.42.2.98   node3.edge.rdo.wales   True
----

When running these commands on the Kubernetes cluster nodes themselves, with a CNI that routes traffic directly to pods (for example, Cilium), you should be able to `ssh` directly to the machine itself. Substitute the following IP address with the one that was assigned to your virtual machine:

[,shell]
----
$ ssh suse@10.42.2.98
(password is "suse")
----

Once you are in this virtual machine, you can play around, but remember that it is limited in terms of resources, and only has 1 GB disk space. When you are finished, `Ctrl-D` or `exit` to disconnect from the SSH session.

The virtual machine process is still wrapped in a standard Kubernetes pod. The `VirtualMachine` CRD is a representation of the desired virtual machine, but the process in which the virtual machine is actually started is via the `https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/main/docs/components.md#virt-launcher[virt-launcher]` pod, a standard Kubernetes pod, just like any other application. For every virtual machine started, you can see there is a `virt-launcher` pod:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl get pods
----

This should then show the one `virt-launcher` pod for the Tumbleweed machine that we have defined:

[,shell]
----
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
virt-launcher-tumbleweed-8gcn4   3/3     Running   0          10m
----

If we take a look into this `virt-launcher` pod, you see it is executing `libvirt` and `qemu-kvm` processes. We can enter the pod itself and have a look under the covers, noting that you need to adapt the following command for your pod name:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl exec -it virt-launcher-tumbleweed-8gcn4 -- bash
----

Once you are in the pod, try running `virsh` commands along with looking at the processes. You will see the `qemu-system-x86_64` binary running, along with certain processes for monitoring the virtual machine. You will also see the location of the disk image and how the networking is plugged (as a tap device):

[,shell]
----

----

Finally, let us delete this virtual machine to clean up:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl delete vm/tumbleweed
virtualmachine.kubevirt.io "tumbleweed" deleted
----

== Using virtctl

Along with the standard Kubernetes CLI tooling, that is, `kubectl`, KubeVirt comes with an accompanying CLI utility that allows you to interface with your cluster in a way that bridges some gaps between the virtualization world and the world that Kubernetes was designed for. For example, the `virtctl` tool provides the capability of managing the lifecycle of virtual machines (starting, stopping, restarting, etc.), providing access to the virtual consoles, uploading virtual machine images, as well as interfacing with Kubernetes constructs such as services, without using the API or CRDs directly.

Let us download the latest stable version of the `virtctl` tool:

[,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
$ export VERSION={version-kubevirt-release}
$ wget https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/download/$VERSION/virtctl-$VERSION-linux-amd64
----

If you are using a different architecture or a non-Linux machine, you can find other releases https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases[here]. You need to make this executable before proceeding, and it may be useful to move it to a location within your `$PATH`:

[,shell]
----
$ mv virtctl-$VERSION-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/virtctl
$ chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/virtctl
----

You can then use the `virtctl` command-line tool to create virtual machines. Let us replicate our previous virtual machine, noting that we are piping the output directly into `kubectl apply`:

[,shell]
----
$ virtctl create vm --name virtctl-example --memory=1Gi \
    --volume-containerdisk=src:registry.opensuse.org/home/roxenham/tumbleweed-container-disk/containerfile/cloud-image:latest \
    --cloud-init-user-data "I2Nsb3VkLWNvbmZpZwpkaXNhYmxlX3Jvb3Q6IGZhbHNlCnNzaF9wd2F1dGg6IFRydWUKdXNlcnM6CiAgLSBkZWZhdWx0CiAgLSBuYW1lOiBzdXNlCiAgICBncm91cHM6IHN1ZG8KICAgIHNoZWxsOiAvYmluL2Jhc2gKICAgIHN1ZG86ICBBTEw9KEFMTCkgTk9QQVNTV0Q6QUxMCiAgICBsb2NrX3Bhc3N3ZDogRmFsc2UKICAgIHBsYWluX3RleHRfcGFzc3dkOiAnc3VzZScK" | kubectl apply -f -
----

This should then show the virtual machine running (it should start a lot quicker this time given that the container image will be cached):

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl get vmi
NAME              AGE   PHASE     IP           NODENAME               READY
virtctl-example   52s   Running   10.42.2.29   node3.edge.rdo.wales   True
----

Now we can use `virtctl` to connect directly to the virtual machine:

[,shell]
----
$ virtctl ssh suse@virtctl-example
(password is "suse" - Ctrl-D to exit)
----

There are plenty of other commands that can be used by `virtctl`. For example, `virtctl console` can give you access to the serial console if networking is not working, and you can use `virtctl  guestosinfo` to get comprehensive OS information, subject to the guest having the `qemu-guest-agent` installed and running.

Finally, let us pause and resume the virtual machine:

[,shell]
----
$ virtctl pause vm virtctl-example
VMI virtctl-example was scheduled to pause
----

You find that the `VirtualMachine` object shows as *Paused* and the `VirtualMachineInstance` object shows as *Running* but *READY=False*:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl get vm
NAME              AGE     STATUS   READY
virtctl-example   8m14s   Paused   False

$ kubectl get vmi
NAME              AGE     PHASE     IP           NODENAME               READY
virtctl-example   8m15s   Running   10.42.2.29   node3.edge.rdo.wales   False
----

You also find that you can no longer connect to the virtual machine:

[,shell]
----
$ virtctl ssh suse@virtctl-example
can't access VMI virtctl-example: Operation cannot be fulfilled on virtualmachineinstance.kubevirt.io "virtctl-example": VMI is paused
----

Let us resume the virtual machine and try again:

[,shell]
----
$ virtctl unpause vm virtctl-example
VMI virtctl-example was scheduled to unpause
----

Now we should be able to re-establish a connection:

[,shell]
----
$ virtctl ssh suse@virtctl-example
suse@vmi/virtctl-example.default's password:
suse@virtctl-example:~> exit
logout
----

Finally, let us remove the virtual machine:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl delete vm/virtctl-example
virtualmachine.kubevirt.io "virtctl-example" deleted
----

== Simple ingress networking

In this section, we show how you can expose virtual machines as standard Kubernetes services and make them available via the Kubernetes ingress service, for example, https://docs.rke2.io/networking/networking_services#nginx-ingress-controller[NGINX with RKE2] or https://docs.k3s.io/networking/networking-services#traefik-ingress-controller[Traefik with K3s]. This document assumes that these components are already configured appropriately and that you have an appropriate DNS pointer, for example, via a wild card, to point at your Kubernetes server nodes or your ingress virtual IP for proper ingress resolution.

> NOTE: In SUSE Edge 3.1+, if you are using K3s in a multi-server node configuration, you might have needed to configure a MetalLB-based VIP for Ingress; this is not required for RKE2.

In the example environment, another openSUSE Tumbleweed virtual machine is deployed, cloud-init is used to install NGINX as a simple Web server at boot time, and a simple message is configured to be returned to verify that it works as expected when a call is made. To see how this is done, simply `base64 -d` the cloud-init section in the output below.

Let us create this virtual machine now:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: ingress-example
  namespace: default
spec:
  runStrategy: Always

        memory:

        resources: {}
      volumes:
      - containerDisk:

        name: tumbleweed-containerdisk-0
      - cloudInitNoCloud:

        name: cloudinitdisk
EOF
----

When this virtual machine has successfully started, we can use the `virtctl` command to expose the `VirtualMachineInstance` with an external port of `8080` and a target port of `80` (where NGINX listens by default). We use the `virtctl` command here as it understands the mapping between the virtual machine object and the pod. This creates a new service for us:

[,shell]
----
$ virtctl expose vmi ingress-example --port=8080 --target-port=80 --name=ingress-example
Service ingress-example successfully exposed for vmi ingress-example
----

We will then have an appropriate service automatically created:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl get svc/ingress-example
NAME              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)                         AGE
ingress-example   ClusterIP      10.43.217.19    <none>            8080/TCP                        9s
----

Next, if you then use `kubectl create ingress`, we can create an ingress object that points to this service. Adapt the URL (known as the "host" in the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_create/kubectl_create_ingress/[ingress] object) here to match your DNS configuration and ensure that you point it to port `8080`:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl create ingress ingress-example --rule=ingress-example.suse.local/=ingress-example:8080
----

With DNS being configured correctly, you should be able to curl the URL immediately:

[,shell]
----
$ curl ingress-example.suse.local
It works!
----

Let us clean up by removing this virtual machine and its service and ingress resources:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl delete vm/ingress-example svc/ingress-example ingress/ingress-example
virtualmachine.kubevirt.io "ingress-example" deleted
service "ingress-example" deleted
ingress.networking.k8s.io "ingress-example" deleted

== Using the Rancher UI extension

SUSE Edge Virtualization provides a UI extension for Rancher Manager, enabling basic virtual machine management using the Rancher dashboard UI.

=== Installation

See <<components-rancher-dashboard-extensions,Rancher Dashboard Extensions>> for installation guidance.

[#kubevirt-dashboard-extension-usage]
=== Using KubeVirt Rancher Dashboard Extension

The extension introduces a new *KubeVirt* section to the Cluster Explorer. This section is added to any managed cluster which has KubeVirt installed.

The extension allows you to directly interact with two KubeVirt resources:

1. `Virtual Machine instances` â€” A resource representing a single running virtual machine instance.
2. `Virtual Machines` â€” A resource used to manage virtual machines lifecycle.

==== Creating a virtual machine

1. Navigate to *Cluster Explorer* clicking KubeVirt-enabled managed cluster in the left navigation.
2. Navigate to *KubeVirt > Virtual Machines* page and click `Create from YAML` in the upper right of the screen.
3. Fill in or paste a virtual machine definition and press `Create`. Use virtual machine definition from Deploying Virtual Machines section as an inspiration.

==== Starting and stopping virtual machines

Start and stop virtual machines using the action menu accessed from the *â‹®* drop-down list to the right of each virtual machine or use group actions at the top of the list by selecting virtual machines to perform the action on.

It is possible to run start and stop actions only on the virtual machines which have `spec.running` property defined. In case when `spec.runStrategy` is used, it is not possible to directly start and stop such a machine. For more information, see https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/virtual_machines/run_strategies/#run-strategies[KubeVirt documentation].

==== Accessing virtual machine console

The "Virtual machines" list provides a `Console` drop-down list that allows to connect to the machine using *VNC or Serial Console*. This action is only available to running machines.

In some cases, it takes a short while before the console is accessible on a freshly started virtual machine.

== Installing with Edge Image Builder

SUSE Edge is using <<components-eib>> in order to customize base SUSE Linux Micro OS images.
Follow <<kubevirt-install>> for an air-gapped installation of both KubeVirt and CDI on top of Kubernetes clusters provisioned by EIB.
