https://metal3.io/[Metal^3^] is a CNCF project which provides bare-metal infrastructure
management capabilities for Kubernetes.

Metal^3^ provides Kubernetes-native resources to manage the lifecycle of bare-metal servers
which support management via out-of-band protocols such as https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish[Redfish].

It also has mature support for https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/[Cluster API (CAPI)] which enables management
of infrastructure resources across multiple infrastructure providers via broadly adopted vendor-neutral APIs.

== How does SUSE Edge use Metal^3^?

This method is useful for scenarios where the target hardware supports out-of-band management, and a fully automated
infrastructure management flow is desired.

This method provides declarative APIs that enable inventory and state management of bare-metal servers, including
automated inspection, cleaning and provisioning/deprovisioning.

== Known issues

* The upstream https://github.com/metal3-io/ip-address-manager[IP Address Management controller] is currently not supported, because it is not yet compatible with our choice of network configuration tooling.
* Relatedly, the IPAM resources and Metal3DataTemplate networkData fields are not supported.
* Only deployment via redfish-virtualmedia is currently supported.
