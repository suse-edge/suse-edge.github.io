Extensions allow users, developers, partners, and customers to extend and enhance the Rancher UI. SUSE Edge 3.0 provides KubeVirt and Akri dashboard extensions.

See `https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/integrations-in-rancher/rancher-extensions[Rancher documentation]` for general information about Rancher Dashboard Extensions.

== Prerequisites

To enable extensions Rancher requires ui-plugin operator to be installed. When using the Rancher Dashboard UI, navigate to *Extensions* in the left navigation *Configuration* section. If the ui-plugin operator is not installed you'll get a prompt asking to enable the extensions support as described `https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/integrations-in-rancher/rancher-extensions#installing-extensions[here]`.

The operator can be also installed using Helm:

[,bash]
----
helm repo add rancher-charts https://charts.rancher.io/
helm upgrade --create-namespace -n cattle-ui-plugin-system \
  --install ui-plugin-operator rancher-charts/ui-plugin-operator
helm upgrade --create-namespace -n cattle-ui-plugin-system \
  --install ui-plugin-operator-crd rancher-charts/ui-plugin-operator-crd
----

Or with Fleet by creating a dedicated GitRepo resource. For more information see xref:fleet.adoc[Fleet] section and `https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/blob/main/gitrepos/rancher-ui-plugin-operator-gitrepo.yaml[fleet-examples]` repository.

== Installation

All SUSE Edge 3.0 components including dashboard extensions are distributed as OCI artefacts. Rancher Dashboard Apps/Marketplace does not support OCI based Helm repositories `https://github.com/rancher/dashboard/issues/9815[yet]`. Therefore to install SUSE Edge Extensions you can use Helm or Fleet:

=== Installing with Helm

[,bash]
----
# KubeVirt extension
helm install kubevirt-dashboard-extension oci://registry.suse.com/edge/kubevirt-dashboard-extension-chart --version 1.0.0 --namespace cattle-ui-plugin-system

# Akri extension
helm install akri-dashboard-extension oci://registry.suse.com/edge/akri-dashboard-extension-chart --version 1.0.0 --namespace cattle-ui-plugin-system
----

[NOTE]
====
The extensions need to be installed in `cattle-ui-plugin-system` namespace.
====

[NOTE]
====
After an extension is installed, Rancher Dashboard UI needs to be reloaded. 
====

=== Installing with Fleet

Installing Dashboard Extensions with Fleet requires defining a `gitRepo` resource which points to a Git repository with custom `fleet.yaml` bundle configuration file(s).

[,yaml]
----
# KubeVirt extension fleet.yaml
defaultNamespace: cattle-ui-plugin-system
helm:
  releaseName: kubevirt-dashboard-extension
  chart: oci://registry.suse.com/edge/akri-dashboard-extension-chart
  version: "1.0.0"
----

[,yaml]
----
# Akri extension fleet.yaml
defaultNamespace: cattle-ui-plugin-system
helm:
  releaseName: akri-dashboard-extension
  chart: oci://registry.suse.com/edge/akri-dashboard-extension-chart
  version: "1.0.0"
----

[NOTE]
====
The `releaseName` property is required and needs to match the extension name to get the extension correctly installed by ui-plugin-operator.
====

[,yaml]
----
cat <<- EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: edge-dashboard-extensions
  namespace: fleet-local
spec:
  repo: https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples.git

EOF

For more information see xref:fleet.adoc[Fleet] section and `https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples[fleet-examples]` repository.

Once the Extensions are installed they are listed in *Extensions* section under *Installed* tabs. Since they are not installed via Apps/Marketplace, they are marked with `Third-Party` label.

== KubeVirt Dashboard Extension

KubeVirt Extension provides basic virtual machine management for Rancher dashboard UI. It's capabilities are described in xref:virtualization.adoc#kubevirt-dashboard-extension[Edge Virtualization]. 

== Akri Dashboard Extension

Akri is a Kubernetes Resource Interface that lets you easily expose heterogeneous leaf devices (such as IP cameras and USB devices) as resources in a Kubernetes cluster, while also supporting the exposure of embedded hardware resources such as GPUs and FPGAs. Akri continually detects nodes that have access to these devices and schedules workloads based on them.

See `https://docs.akri.sh/[Akri documentation]` for detailed information.

Akri Dashboard Extension allows you to use Rancher Dashboard user interface to manage and monitor leaf devices and workloads running once these devices are discovered.

Once the extension is installed you can navigate to any Akri-enabled managed cluster using cluster explorer. Under *Akri* navigation group you can see Configurations and Instances sections.

image::akri-extension-configurations.png[]

The configurations list provides information about Configuration Discovery Handler and number of instances. Clicking the name opens a configuration detail page.

You can also edit or create a new Configuration. Extension allows you to select discovery handler, set up Broker Pod or Job, configure Configuration and Instance services and set the Configuration capacity.

Discovered devices are listed in the *Instances* list.

Clicking the Instance name opens a detail page allowing to view the workloads and instance service.
