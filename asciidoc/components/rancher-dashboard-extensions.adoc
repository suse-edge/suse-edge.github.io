Extensions allow users, developers, partners, and customers to extend and enhance the Rancher UI. SUSE Edge provides KubeVirt dashboard extensions.

See `{link-rancher-extensions}[Rancher documentation]` for general information about Rancher Dashboard Extensions.

== Installation

All of the SUSE Edge {version-edge} components, including dashboard extensions, are distributed as OCI artifacts. To install SUSE Edge Extensions you can use Rancher Dashboard UI, Helm or Fleet:

=== Installing with Rancher Dashboard UI

. Click *Extensions* in the *Configuration* section of the navigation sidebar.
. On the Extensions page, click the three dot menu at the top right and select *Manage Repositories*.
+
Each extension is distributed via its own OCI artifact. They are available from the SUSE Edge Helm charts repository. 

. On the *Repositories page*, click `Create`.
. In the form, specify the repository name and URL, and click `Create`.
+
SUSE Edge Helm charts repository URL:
`oci://registry.suse.com/edge/charts`
+

. On the extension card click `Install` and confirm the installation.
+
Once the extension is installed Rancher UI prompts to reload the page as described in the `https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/{rancher-docs-version}/integrations-in-rancher/rancher-extensions#installing-extensions[Installing Extensions Rancher documentation page]`.


=== Installing with Helm

[,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
# KubeVirt extension
helm install kubevirt-dashboard-extension oci://registry.suse.com/edge/charts/kubevirt-dashboard-extension --version {version-kubevirt-dashboard-extension-chart} --namespace cattle-ui-plugin-system
----

[NOTE]
====
The extensions need to be installed in `cattle-ui-plugin-system` namespace.
====

[NOTE]
====
After an extension is installed, Rancher Dashboard UI needs to be reloaded. 
====

=== Installing with Fleet

Installing Dashboard Extensions with Fleet requires defining a `gitRepo` resource which points to a Git repository with custom `fleet.yaml` bundle configuration file(s).

[,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
# KubeVirt extension fleet.yaml
defaultNamespace: cattle-ui-plugin-system
helm:
  releaseName: kubevirt-dashboard-extension
  chart: oci://registry.suse.com/edge/charts/kubevirt-dashboard-extension
  version: "{version-kubevirt-dashboard-extension-chart}"
----

[NOTE]
====
The `releaseName` property is required and needs to match the extension name to get the extension correctly installed.
====

[,yaml]
----
cat <<- EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: edge-dashboard-extensions
  namespace: fleet-local
spec:
  repo: https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples.git
  branch: main
  paths:
  - fleets/kubevirt-dashboard-extension/
EOF
----

For more information, see <<components-fleet>> and the `https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples[fleet-examples]` repository.

Once the Extensions are installed they are listed in *Extensions* section under *Installed* tabs. Since they are not installed via Apps/Marketplace, they are marked with `Third-Party` label.
