Extensions allow users, developers, partners, and customers to extend and enhance the Rancher UI. SUSE Edge 3.1 provides KubeVirt and Akri dashboard extensions.

See `{link-rancher-extensions}[Rancher documentation]` for general information about Rancher Dashboard Extensions.

== Installation

All of the SUSE Edge {version-edge} components, including dashboard extensions, are distributed as OCI artifacts. To install SUSE Edge Extensions you can use Rancher Dashboard UI, Helm or Fleet:

=== Installing with Rancher Dashboard UI

. Click *Extensions* in the *Configuration* section of the navigation sidebar.
. On the Extensions page, click the three dot menu at the top right and select *Manage Repositories*.
+
Each extension is distributed via its own OCI artifact. Therefore, you need to add repositories for each extension that needs to be installed. 

. On the *Repositories page*, click `Create`.
. In the form, specify the repository name and OCI artifact URL, and click `Create`.
+
Akri Dashboard Extension Repository URL:
`oci://registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/akri-dashboard-extension-chart`
+
KubeVirt Dashboard Extension Repository URL:
`oci://registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/kubevirt-dashboard-extension-chart`
+

. You can see that the extension repository is added to the list and is in `Active` state.
+

. Navigate back to the *Extensions* in the *Configuration* section of the navigation sidebar.
+
In the *Available* tab you can see the extensions available for installation.
+

. On the extension card click `Install` and confirm the installation.
+
Once the extension is installed Rancher UI prompts to reload the page as described in the `https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/{rancher-docs-version}/integrations-in-rancher/rancher-extensions#installing-extensions[Installing Extensions Rancher documentation page]`.



=== Installing with Helm

[,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
# KubeVirt extension
helm install kubevirt-dashboard-extension oci://registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/kubevirt-dashboard-extension-chart --version {version-kubevirt-dashboard-extension-chart} --namespace cattle-ui-plugin-system

# Akri extension
helm install akri-dashboard-extension oci://registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/akri-dashboard-extension-chart --version {version-akri-dashboard-extension-chart} --namespace cattle-ui-plugin-system
----

[NOTE]
====
The extensions need to be installed in `cattle-ui-plugin-system` namespace.
====

[NOTE]
====
After an extension is installed, Rancher Dashboard UI needs to be reloaded. 
====

=== Installing with Fleet

Installing Dashboard Extensions with Fleet requires defining a `gitRepo` resource which points to a Git repository with custom `fleet.yaml` bundle configuration file(s).

[,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
# KubeVirt extension fleet.yaml
defaultNamespace: cattle-ui-plugin-system
helm:
  releaseName: kubevirt-dashboard-extension
  chart: oci://registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/kubevirt-dashboard-extension-chart
  version: "{version-kubevirt-dashboard-extension-chart}"
----

[,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
# Akri extension fleet.yaml
defaultNamespace: cattle-ui-plugin-system
helm:
  releaseName: akri-dashboard-extension
  chart: oci://registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/akri-dashboard-extension-chart
  version: "{version-akri-dashboard-extension-chart}"
----

[NOTE]
====
The `releaseName` property is required and needs to match the extension name to get the extension correctly installed.
====

[,yaml]
----
cat <<- EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: edge-dashboard-extensions
  namespace: fleet-local
spec:
  repo: https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples.git
  branch: main
  paths:
  - fleets/kubevirt-dashboard-extension/
  - fleets/akri-dashboard-extension/
EOF
----

For more information, see <<components-fleet>> and the `https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples[fleet-examples]` repository.

Once the Extensions are installed they are listed in *Extensions* section under *Installed* tabs. Since they are not installed via Apps/Marketplace, they are marked with `Third-Party` label.

== KubeVirt Dashboard Extension

KubeVirt Extension provides basic virtual machine management for Rancher dashboard UI. Its capabilities are described in <<kubevirt-dashboard-extension-usage>>.

== Akri Dashboard Extension

Akri is a Kubernetes Resource Interface that lets you easily expose heterogeneous leaf devices (such as IP cameras and USB devices) as resources in a Kubernetes cluster, while also supporting the exposure of embedded hardware resources such as GPUs and FPGAs. Akri continually detects nodes that have access to these devices and schedules workloads based on them.

Akri Dashboard Extension allows you to use Rancher Dashboard user interface to manage and monitor leaf devices and run workloads once these devices are discovered.

Extension capabilities are further described in <<akri-dashboard-extension-usage>>.
