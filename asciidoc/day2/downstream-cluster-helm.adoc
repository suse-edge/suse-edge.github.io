[NOTE]
====
The below sections focus on using `Fleet` functionalities to achieve a Helm chart update.

For use-cases, where a third party GitOps tool usage is desired, see:

* For `EIB deployed Helm chart upgrades` - <<day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-third-party>>.

* For `non-EIB deployed Helm chart upgrades` - retrieve the chart version supported by the desired Edge release from the <<release-notes, release notes>> page and populate the chart version and URL in your third party GitOps tool.
====

=== Components

Apart from the default `Day 2` <<day2-downstream-components, components>>, no other custom components are needed for this operation.

=== Preparation for air-gapped environments

==== Ensure that you have access to your Helm chart upgrade Fleet

Depending on what your environment supports, you can take one of the following options:

. Host your chart's Fleet resources on a local Git server that is accessible by your `management cluster`.

. Use Fleet's CLI to link:https://fleet.rancher.io/bundle-add#convert-a-helm-chart-into-a-bundle[convert a Helm chart into a Bundle] that you can directly use and will not need to be hosted somewhere. Fleet's CLI can be retrieved from their link:https://github.com/rancher/fleet/releases[release] page, for Mac users there is a link:https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/fleet-cli[fleet-cli] Homebrew Formulae.

==== Find the required assets for your Edge release version

. Go to the Day 2 link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] page and find the Edge 3.X.Y release that you want to upgrade your chart to and click *Assets*.

. From the *"Assets"* section, download the following files:
+
[cols="1,1"]
|======
|*Release File* 
|*Description*

|_edge-save-images.sh_
|Pulls the images specified in the `edge-release-images.txt` file and packages them inside of a '.tar.gz' archive.

|_edge-save-oci-artefacts.sh_
|Pulls the OCI chart images related to the specific Edge release and packages them inside of a '.tar.gz' archive.

|_edge-load-images.sh_
|Loads images from a '.tar.gz' archive, retags and pushes them to a private registry.

|_edge-load-oci-artefacts.sh_
|Takes a directory containing Edge OCI '.tgz' chart packages and loads them to a private registry.

|_edge-release-helm-oci-artefacts.txt_
|Contains a list of OCI chart images related to a specific Edge release.

|_edge-release-images.txt_
|Contains a list of images related to a specific Edge release.
|======

==== Create the Edge release images archive

_On a machine with internet access:_

. Make `edge-save-images.sh` executable:
+
[,bash]
----
chmod +x edge-save-images.sh
----

. Generate the image archive:
+
[,bash]
----
./edge-save-images.sh --source-registry registry.suse.com
----

. This will create a ready to load archive named `edge-images.tar.gz`.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the `-i|--images` option is specified, the name of the archive may differ.
====

. Copy this archive to your *air-gapped* machine:
+
[,bash]
----
scp edge-images.tar.gz <user>@<machine_ip>:/path
----

==== Create the Edge OCI chart images archive

_On a machine with internet access:_

. Make `edge-save-oci-artefacts.sh` executable:
+
[,bash]
----
chmod +x edge-save-oci-artefacts.sh
----

. Generate the OCI chart image archive:
+
[,bash]
----
./edge-save-oci-artefacts.sh --source-registry registry.suse.com
----

. This will create an archive named `oci-artefacts.tar.gz`.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the `-a|--archive` option is specified, the name of the archive may differ.
====

. Copy this archive to your *air-gapped* machine:
+
[,bash]
----
scp oci-artefacts.tar.gz <user>@<machine_ip>:/path
----

==== Load Edge release images to your air-gapped machine

_On your air-gapped machine:_

. Log into your private registry (if required):
+
[,bash]
----
podman login <REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>
----

. Make `edge-load-images.sh` executable:
+
[,bash]
----
chmod +x edge-load-images.sh
----

. Execute the script, passing the previously *copied* `edge-images.tar.gz` archive:
+
[,bash]
----
./edge-load-images.sh --source-registry registry.suse.com --registry <REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT> --images edge-images.tar.gz
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This will load all images from the `edge-images.tar.gz`, retag and push them to the registry specified under the `--registry` option.
====

==== Load the Edge OCI chart images to your air-gapped machine

_On your air-gapped machine:_

. Log into your private registry (if required):
+
[,bash]
----
podman login <REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>
----

. Make `edge-load-oci-artefacts.sh` executable:
+
[,bash]
----
chmod +x edge-load-oci-artefacts.sh
----

. Untar the copied `oci-artefacts.tar.gz` archive:
+
[,bash]
----
tar -xvf oci-artefacts.tar.gz
----

. This will produce a directory with the naming template `edge-release-oci-tgz-<date>`

. Pass this directory to the `edge-load-oci-artefacts.sh` script to load the Edge OCI chart images to your private registry:
+
[NOTE]
====
This script assumes the `helm` CLI has been pre-installed on your environment. For Helm installation instructions, see link:https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Installing Helm].
====
+
[,bash]
----
./edge-load-oci-artefacts.sh --archive-directory edge-release-oci-tgz-<date> --registry <REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT> --source-registry registry.suse.com
----

==== Create registry mirrors pointing to your private registry for your Kubernetes distribution

For RKE2, see link:https://docs.rke2.io/install/containerd_registry_configuration[Containerd Registry Configuration]

For K3s, see link:https://docs.k3s.io/installation/registry-mirror[Embedded Registry Mirror]

=== Upgrade procedure

This section focuses on the following Helm upgrade procedure use-cases:

. <<day2-helm-upgrade-new-cluster, I have a new cluster and would like to deploy and manage a SUSE Helm chart>>

. <<day2-helm-upgrade-fleet-managed-chart, I would like to upgrade a Fleet managed Helm chart>>

. <<day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart, I would like to upgrade an EIB deployed Helm chart>>

[IMPORTANT]
====
Manually deployed Helm charts cannot be reliably upgraded. We suggest to redeploy the helm chart using the <<day2-helm-upgrade-new-cluster>> method.
====

[#day2-helm-upgrade-new-cluster]
==== I have a new cluster and would like to deploy and manage a SUSE Helm chart

For users that want to manage their Helm chart lifecycle through Fleet.

This section covers how to:

. <<day2-helm-upgrade-new-cluster-prepare-fleet, Prepare your Fleet resources>>.

. <<day2-helm-upgrade-new-cluster-deploy-fleet, Deploy your Fleet resources>>.

. <<day2-helm-upgrade-new-cluster-manage-chart, Manage the deployed Helm chart>>.

[#day2-helm-upgrade-new-cluster-prepare-fleet]
===== Prepare your Fleet resources

. Acquire the Chart's Fleet resources from the Edge link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag that you wish to use

.. From the selected Edge release tag revision, navigate to the Helm chart fleet - `fleets/day2/chart-templates/<chart>`

.. *If you intend to use a GitOps workflow*, copy the chart Fleet directory to the Git repository from where you will do GitOps.

.. *Optionally*, if the Helm chart requires configurations to its *values*, edit the `.helm.values` configuration inside the `fleet.yaml` file of the copied directory.

.. *Optionally*, there may be use-cases where you need to add additional resources to your chart's fleet so that it can better fit your environment. For information on how to enhance your Fleet directory, see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-content[Git Repository Contents].

An *example* for the `longhorn` helm chart would look like:

* User Git repository structure:
+
[,bash]
----
<user_repository_root>
├── longhorn
│   └── fleet.yaml
└── longhorn-crd
    └── fleet.yaml

====

[#day2-helm-upgrade-new-cluster-deploy-fleet]
===== Deploy your Fleet

If the environment supports working with a GitOps workflow, you can deploy your Chart Fleet by either using a <<day2-helm-upgrade-new-cluster-deploy-fleet-gitrepo, GitRepo>> or <<day2-helm-upgrade-new-cluster-deploy-fleet-bundle, Bundle>>.

[NOTE]
====
While deploying your Fleet, if you get a `Modified` message, make sure to add a corresponding `comparePatches` entry to the Fleet's `diff` section. For more information, see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/bundle-diffs[Generating Diffs to Ignore Modified GitRepos].
====

[#day2-helm-upgrade-new-cluster-deploy-fleet-gitrepo]
====== GitRepo

Fleet's link:https://fleet.rancher.io/ref-gitrepo[GitRepo] resource holds information on how to access your chart's Fleet resources and to which clusters it needs to apply those resources.

The `GitRepo` resource can be deployed through the link:https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/integrations-in-rancher/fleet/overview#accessing-fleet-in-the-rancher-ui[Rancher UI], or manually, by link:https://fleet.rancher.io/tut-deployment[deploying] the resource to the `management cluster`.

_Example *Longhorn* `GitRepo` resource for *manual* deployment:_

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
kind: GitRepo
metadata:
  name: longhorn-git-repo
  namespace: fleet-default
spec:
  # If using a tag
  # revision: <user_repository_tag>
  # 
  # If using a branch
  # branch: <user_repository_branch>
  paths:
  # As seen in the 'Prepare your Fleet resources' example
  - longhorn
  - longhorn-crd
  repo: <user_repository_url>
  targets:
  # Match all clusters
  - clusterSelector: {}
----

[#day2-helm-upgrade-new-cluster-deploy-fleet-bundle]
====== Bundle

link:https://fleet.rancher.io/bundle-add[Bundle] resources hold the raw Kubernetes resources that need to be deployed by Fleet. Normally it is encouraged to use the `GitRepo` approach, but for use-cases where the environment is air-gapped and cannot support a local Git server, `Bundles` can help you in propagating your Helm chart Fleet to your target clusters.

The `Bundle` can be deployed either through the Rancher UI (`Continuous Delivery -> Advanced -> Bundles -> Create from YAML`) or by manually deploying the `Bundle` resource in the correct Fleet namespace. For information about Fleet namespaces, see the upstream link:https://fleet.rancher.io/namespaces#gitrepos-bundles-clusters-clustergroups[documentation].

_Example *Longhorn* `Bundle` resource deployment using a *manual* approach:_

. Navigate to the `Longhorn` Chart fleet located under `fleets/day2/chart-templates/longhorn/longhorn`:
+
[,bash]
----
cd fleets/day2/chart-templates/longhorn/longhorn
----

. Create a `targets.yaml` file that will instruct Fleet to which clusters it should deploy the Helm chart. In this case, we will deploy to a single downstream cluster. For information on how to map more complex targets, see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-targets[Mapping to Downstream Clusters]:
+
[,bash]
----
cat > targets.yaml <<EOF
targets:
- clusterName: foo
EOF
----

. Convert the `Longhorn` Helm chart Fleet to a Bundle resource. For more information, see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/bundle-add#convert-a-helm-chart-into-a-bundle[Convert a Helm Chart into a Bundle]:
+
[,bash]
----
fleet apply --compress --targets-file=targets.yaml -n fleet-default -o - longhorn-bundle > longhorn-bundle.yaml
----

. Navigate to the `Longhorn CRD` Chart fleet located under `fleets/day2/chart-templates/longhorn/longhorn-crd`:
+
[,bash]
----
cd fleets/day2/chart-templates/longhorn/longhorn-crd
----

. Create a `targets.yaml` file that will instruct Fleet to which clusters it should deploy the Helm chart. In this case, we will deploy to a single downstream cluster. For information on how to map more complex targets, see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-targets[Mapping to Downstream Clusters]:
+
[,bash]
----
cat > targets.yaml <<EOF
targets:
- clusterName: foo
EOF
----

. Convert the `Longhorn CRD` Helm chart Fleet to a Bundle resource. For more information, see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/bundle-add#convert-a-helm-chart-into-a-bundle[Convert a Helm Chart into a Bundle]:
+
[,bash]
----
fleet apply --compress --targets-file=targets.yaml -n fleet-default -o - longhorn-crd-bundle > longhorn-crd-bundle.yaml
----

. Deploy `longhorn-bundle.yaml` and `longhorn-crd-bundle.yaml` to your `management cluster`:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f longhorn-crd-bundle.yaml
kubectl apply -f longhorn-bundle.yaml
----

Following these steps will ensure that `Longhorn` is deployed on all of the specified target clusters.

[#day2-helm-upgrade-new-cluster-manage-chart]
===== Managing the deployed Helm chart

Once deployed with Fleet, for Helm chart upgrades, see <<day2-helm-upgrade-fleet-managed-chart>>.

[#day2-helm-upgrade-fleet-managed-chart]
==== I would like to upgrade a Fleet managed Helm chart

. Determine the version to which you need to upgrade your chart so that it is compatible with the desired Edge release. Helm chart version per Edge release can be viewed from the <<release-notes, release notes>>.

. In your Fleet monitored Git repository, edit the Helm chart's `fleet.yaml` file with the correct chart *version* and *repository* from the <<release-notes, release notes>>.

. After committing and pushing the changes to your repository, this will trigger an upgrade of the desired Helm chart

[#day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart]
==== I would like to upgrade an EIB deployed Helm chart

EIB deploys Helm charts by creating a `HelmChart` resource and utilizing the `helm-controller` introduced by the link:https://docs.rke2.io/helm[RKE2]/link:https://docs.k3s.io/helm[K3s] Helm integration feature.

To ensure that an EIB deployed Helm chart is successfully upgraded, users need to do an upgrade over the `HelmChart` resources created for the Helm chart by EIB.

Below you can find information on:

* The general <<day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-overview,overview>> of the EIB deployed Helm chart upgrade process.

* The necessary <<day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-upgrade-steps,upgrade steps>> needed for a successful EIB deployed Helm chart upgrade.

* An <<day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-example, example>> showcasing a link:https://longhorn.io[Longhorn] chart upgrade using the explained method.

* How to use the upgrade process with <<day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-third-party, a different GitOps tool>>.

[#day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-overview]
===== Overview

This section is meant to give a high overview of the steps that need to be taken in order to upgrade one or multiple Helm charts that have been deployed by EIB. For a detailed explanation of the steps needed for a Helm chart upgrade, see <<day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-upgrade-steps>>.

.Helm chart upgrade workflow
image::day2_helm_chart_upgrade_diagram.png[]

. The workflow begins with the user link:https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_pull/[pulling] the new Helm chart archive(s) that he wishes to upgrade his chart(s) to.

. The archive(s) should then be placed in a directory that will be processed by the `generate-chart-upgrade-data.sh` script.

. The user then proceeds to execute the `generate-chart-upgrade-data.sh` script which will generate a Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Secret] YAML file for each Helm chart archive in the provided archive directory. These secrets will be automatically placed under the Fleet that will be used to upgrade the Helm charts. This is further explained in the <<day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-upgrade-steps, upgrade steps>> section.

. After the script finishes successfully, the user should continue to the configuration and deployment of either a `Bundle` or a `GitRepo` resource that will ship all the needed K8s resources to the target clusters.

.. The resource is deployed on the `management cluster` under the `fleet-default` namespace.

. <<components-fleet,Fleet>> detects the deployed resource, parses its data and deploys its resources to the specified target clusters. The most notable resources that are deployed are:

.. `eib-charts-upgrader` - a Job that deploys the `Chart Upgrade Pod`. The `eib-charts-upgrader-script` as well as all `helm chart upgrade data` secrets are mounted inside of the `Chart Upgrade Pod`.

.. `eib-charts-upgrader-script` - a Secret shipping the script that will be used by the `Chart Upgrade Pod` to patch an existing `HelmChart` resource.

.. `Helm chart upgrade data` secrets - Secret YAML files created by the `generate-chart-upgrade-data.sh` script based on the user provided data. *Secret YAML files should not be edited.*

. Once the `Chart Upgrade Pod` has been deployed, the script from the `eib-charts-upgrader-script` secret is executed, which does the following:

.. Process all the Helm chart upgrade data provided by the other secrets.

.. Check if there is a `HelmChart` resource for each of the provided chart upgrade data.

.. Proceed to patch the `HelmChart` resource with the data provided from the secret for the corresponding Helm chart.

. RKE2/K3s helm-controller constantly monitors for edits over the existing `HelmChart` resource. It detects the patch of the `HelmChart`, reconciles the changes and then proceeds to upgrade the chart behind the `HelmChart` resource.

[#day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-upgrade-steps]
===== Upgrade Steps

. Clone the link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples[suse-edge/fleet-examples] repository from the Edge link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release tag] that you wish to use.

. Create a directory in which you will store the pulled Helm chart archive(s).
+
[,bash]
----
mkdir archives
----

. Inside of the newly created archive directory, link:https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_pull/[pull] the Helm chart archive(s) that you wish to upgrade to:
+
[,bash]
----
cd archives
helm pull [chart URL | repo/chartname]

# Alternatively if you want to pull a specific version:
# helm pull [chart URL | repo/chartname] --version 0.0.0
----

. From the desired link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release tag] download the `generate-chart-upgrade-data.sh` script.

. Execute the `generate-chart-upgrade-data.sh` script:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Users should not make any changes over what the `generate-chart-upgrade-data.sh` script generates.
====
+
[,bash]
----
chmod +x ./generate-chart-upgrade-data.sh

./generate-chart-upgrade-data.sh --archive-dir /foo/bar/archives/ --fleet-path /foo/bar/fleet-examples/fleets/day2/eib-charts-upgrader
----
+
The script will go through the following logic:

.. Validate that the user has provided `--fleet-path` points to a valid Fleet that can initiate a Helm chart upgrade.

.. Process all Helm chart archives from the user-created archives dir (e.g. `/foo/bar/archives/`).

.. For each Helm chart archive create a `Kubernetes Secret YAML` resource. This resource will hold:

... The `name` of the `HelmChart` resource that needs to be patched.

... The new `version` for the `HelmChart` resource.

... The `base64` encoded Helm chart archive that will be used to replace the `HelmChart's` currently running configuration.

.. Each `Kubernetes Secret YAML` resource will be transferred to the `base/secrets` directory inside of the path to the `eib-charts-upgrader` Fleet that was given under `--fleet-path`.

.. Furthermore the `generate-chart-upgrade-data.sh` script ensures that the secrets that it moved will be picked up and used in the Helm chart upgrade logic. It does that by:

... Editing the `base/secrets/kustomization.yaml` file to include the newly added resources.

... Edit the `base/patches/job-patch.yaml` file to include the newly added secrets to the mount configurations.

. After a successful `generate-chart-upgrade-data.sh` run you should have the changes inside of the following directories of the `suse-edge/fleet-examples` repository:

.. `fleets/day2/eib-charts-upgrader/base/patches`

.. `fleets/day2/eib-charts-upgrader/base/secrets`

The steps below depend on the environment that you are running:

. For an environment that supports GitOps (e.g. is non air-gapped, or is air-gapped, but allows for local Git server support):

.. Copy the `fleets/day2/eib-charts-upgrader` Fleet to the repository that you will use for GitOps. Make sure that the Fleet includes the changes that have been made by the `generate-chart-upgrade-data.sh` script.

.. Configure a `GitRepo` resource that will be used to ship all the resources of the `eib-charts-upgrader` Fleet.

... For `GitRepo` configuration and deployment through the Rancher UI, see link:https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/v2.8/integrations-in-rancher/fleet/overview#accessing-fleet-in-the-rancher-ui[Accessing Fleet in the Rancher UI].

... For `GitRepo` manual configuration and deployment, see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/tut-deployment[Creating a Deployment].

. For an environment that does not support GitOps (e.g. is air-gapped and does not allow local Git server usage):

.. Download the `fleet-cli` binary from the `rancher/fleet` link:https://github.com/rancher/fleet/releases[releases] page. For Mac users, there is a Homebrew Formulae that can be used - link:https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/fleet-cli[fleet-cli].

.. Navigate to the `eib-charts-upgrader` Fleet:
+
[,bash]
----
cd /foo/bar/fleet-examples/fleets/day2/eib-charts-upgrader
----

.. Create a `targets.yaml` file that will instruct Fleet where to deploy your resources:
+
[,bash]
----
cat > targets.yaml <<EOF
targets:
- clusterSelector: {} # Change this with your target data
EOF
----
+
For information on how to map target clusters, see the upstream link:https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-targets[documentation].

.. Use the `fleet-cli` to convert the Fleet to a `Bundle` resource:
+
[,bash]
----
fleet apply --compress --targets-file=targets.yaml -n fleet-default -o - eib-charts-upgrade > bundle.yaml
----
+
This will create a Bundle (`bundle.yaml`) that will hold all the templated resource from the `eib-charts-upgrader` Fleet.
+
For more information regarding the `fleet apply` command, see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/cli/fleet-cli/fleet_apply[fleet apply].
+
For more information regarding converting Fleets to Bundles, see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/bundle-add#convert-a-helm-chart-into-a-bundle[Convert a Helm Chart into a Bundle].

.. Deploy the `Bundle`. This can be done in one of two ways:

... Through Rancher's UI - Navigate to *Continuous Delivery -> Advanced -> Bundles -> Create from YAML* and either paste the `bundle.yaml` contents, or click the `Read from File` option and pass the file itself.

... Manually - Deploy the `bundle.yaml` file manually inside of your `management cluster`.

Executing these steps will result in a successfully deployed `GitRepo/Bundle` resource. The resource will be picked up by Fleet and its contents will be deployed onto the target clusters that the user has specified in the previous steps. For an overview of the process, refer to the <<day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-overview, overview>> section.

For information on how to track the upgrade process, you can refer to the <<day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-example, Example>> section of this documentation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Once the chart upgrade has been successfully verified, remove the `Bundle/GitRepo` resource. 

This will remove the no longer necessary upgrade resources from your downstream cluster, ensuring that no future version clashes might occur. 
====

[#day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-example]
===== Example

[NOTE]
====
The example below illustrates how to do an upgrade of an EIB deployed Helm chart from one version to another. The versions in the example should *not* be treated as version recommendations. Version recommendations for a specific Edge release, should be taken from the <<release-notes, release notes>>.
====

_Use-case:_

- A cluster named `doc-example` is running Ranchers' link:https://longhorn.io[Longhorn] `103.3.0+up1.6.1` version.

- The cluster has been deployed through EIB, using the following image definition _snippet_:
+
[,yaml]
----
kubernetes:
  helm:
    charts:
    - name: longhorn-crd
      repositoryName: rancher-charts
      targetNamespace: longhorn-system
      createNamespace: true
      version: 103.3.0+up1.6.1
    - name: longhorn
      repositoryName: rancher-charts
      targetNamespace: longhorn-system
      createNamespace: true
      version: 103.3.0+up1.6.1
    repositories:
    - name: rancher-charts
      url: https://charts.rancher.io/
...
----
+
.doc-example installed Longhorn version
image::day2_helm_chart_upgrade_example_1.png[]

- `Longhorn` needs to be upgraded to a version that is compatible with the Edge 3.1 release. Meaning it needs to be upgraded to `104.2.0+up1.7.1`.

- It is assumed that the `management cluster` in charge of managing the `doc-example` cluster is *air-gapped*, without support for a local Git server and has a working Rancher setup.

Follow the <<day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-upgrade-steps, Upgrade Steps>>:

. Clone the `suse-edge/fleet-example` repository from the `release-3.1.1` tag.
+
[,bash]
----
git clone -b release-3.1.1 https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples.git
----

. Create a directory where the `Longhorn` upgrade archive will be stored.
+
[,bash]
----
mkdir archives
----

. Pull the desired `Longhorn` chart archive version:
+
[,bash]
----
# First add the Rancher Helm chart repository
helm repo add rancher-charts https://charts.rancher.io/

# Pull the Longhorn 1.7.1 CRD archive

The files changed in git should look like this:

.Changes over fleet-examples made by generate-chart-upgrade-data.sh

. Since the `management cluster` does not support for a GitOps workflow, a `Bundle` needs to be created for the `eib-charts-upgrader` Fleet:

.. First, navigate to the Fleet itself:
+
[,bash]
----
cd ./fleet-examples/fleets/day2/eib-charts-upgrader
----

.. Then create a `targets.yaml` file targeting the `doc-example` cluster:
+
[,bash]
----
cat > targets.yaml <<EOF
targets:
- clusterName: doc-example
EOF
----

.. Then use the `fleet-cli` binary to convert the Fleet to a Bundle:
+
[,bash]
----
fleet apply --compress --targets-file=targets.yaml -n fleet-default -o - eib-charts-upgrade > bundle.yaml
----

.. Now, transfer the `bundle.yaml` on your `management cluster` machine.

. Since the `management cluster` is running `Rancher`, deploy the Bundle through the Rancher UI:
+
.Deploy Bundle through Rancher UI
image::day2_helm_chart_upgrade_example_3.png[]
+
From here, select *Read from File* and find the `bundle.yaml` file on your system.
+
This will auto-populate the `Bundle` inside of Rancher's UI:
+
.Auto-populated Bundle snippet
image::day2_helm_chart_upgrade_example_4.png[]
+
Select *Create*.

. After a successful deployment, your Bundle would look similar to:
+
.Successfully deployed Bundle
image::day2_helm_chart_upgrade_example_5.png[]

After the successful deployment of the `Bundle`, to monitor the upgrade process:

. First, verify the logs of the `Upgrade Pod`:
+
.View the upgrade pod logs
image::day2_helm_chart_upgrade_example_6.png[]

. Now verify the logs of the Pod created for the upgrade by the helm-controller:

.. The Pod name will be with the following template - `helm-install-longhorn-<random-suffix>`

.. The Pod will be in the namespace where the `HelmChart` resource was deployed. In our case this is `default`.
+
.Logs for successfully upgraded Longhorn chart
image::day2_helm_chart_upgrade_example_8.png[]

. Check that the HelmChart version has been bumped:
+
.Bumped Longhorn version
image::day2_helm_chart_upgrade_example_9.png[]

. Finally check that the Longhorn Pods are running:
+
.Example for validating the instance-manager pod
image::day2_helm_chart_upgrade_example_10.png[]

After making the above validations, it is safe to assume that the Longhorn Helm chart has been upgraded from `103.3.0+up1.6.1` to `104.2.0+up1.7.1`.

[#day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-third-party]
===== Helm chart upgrade using a third-party GitOps tool

There might be use-cases where users would like to use this upgrade procedure with a GitOps workflow other than Fleet (e.g. `Flux`).

To produce the resources needed for the upgrade procedure, you can use the `generate-chart-upgrade-data.sh` script to populate the `eib-charts-upgrader` Fleet with the user provided data. For more information on how to do this, see the <<day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-upgrade-steps, upgrade steps>>.

After you have the full setup, you can use link:https://kustomize.io[kustomize] to generate a full working solution that you can deploy in your cluster:

[,bash]
----
cd /foo/bar/fleets/day2/eib-charts-upgrader

kustomize build .
----

If you want to include the solution to your GitOps workflow, you can remove the `fleet.yaml` file and use what is left as a valid `Kustomize` setup. Just do not forget to first run the `generate-chart-upgrade-data.sh` script, so that it can populate the `Kustomize` setup with the data for the Helm charts that you wish to upgrade to.

To understand how this workflow is intended to be used, it can be beneficial to look at the <<day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-overview,overview>> and <<day2-helm-upgrade-eib-chart-upgrade-steps, upgrade steps>> sections as well.
