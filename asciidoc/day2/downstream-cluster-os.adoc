=== Components

This section covers the custom components that the `OS upgrade` process uses over the default `Day 2` <<day2-downstream-components, components>>.

==== systemd.service

A different link:https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html[systemd.service] is created depending on what upgrade your OS requires from one Edge version to another:

* For Edge versions that require the same OS version (e.g. `6.0`), the `os-pkg-update.service` will be created. It uses the link:https://kubic.opensuse.org/documentation/man-pages/transactional-update.8.html[transactional-update] command to perform a link:https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Zypper_usage#Updating_packages[normal package upgrade].

* For Edge versions that require a OS version migration (e.g `5.5` -> `6.0`), the `os-migration.service` will be created. It uses link:https://kubic.opensuse.org/documentation/man-pages/transactional-update.8.html[transactional-update] to perform:

** First a link:https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Zypper_usage#Updating_packages[normal package upgrade]. Done in order to ensure that all packages are with the latest version before the migration. Mitigating any failures related to old package version.

** After that it proceeds with the OS migration process by utilising the `zypper migration` command.

Shipped through a *SUC plan*, which should be located on each *downstream cluster* that is in need of a OS upgrade.

=== Requirements

_General:_

. *SCC registered machine* - All downstream cluster nodes should be registered to `https://scc.suse.com/`. This is needed so that the `os-pkg-update.service/os-migration.service` can successfully connect to the needed OS RPM repositories.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For Edge releases that require a new OS version (e.g Edge 3.1), make sure that your SCC key supports the migration to the new version (e.g. for Edge 3.1, the SCC key should support SLE Micro `5.5` -> `6.0` migration).
====

. *Make sure that SUC Plan tolerations match node tolerations* - If your Kubernetes cluster nodes have custom *taints*, make sure to add link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/[tolerations] for those taints in the *SUC Plans*. By default *SUC Plans* have tolerations only for *control-plane* nodes. Default tolerations include:

* _CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoExecute_

* _node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule_

* _node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd:NoExecute_
+
[NOTE]
====
Any additional tolerations must be added under the `.spec.tolerations` section of each Plan. *SUC Plans* related to the OS upgrade can be found in the link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples[suse-edge/fleet-examples] repository under `fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/os-upgrade`. *Make sure you use the Plans from a valid repository link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag.*

An example of defining custom tolerations for the *control-plane* SUC Plan, would look like this:
[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: upgrade.cattle.io/v1
kind: Plan
metadata:
  name: cp-os-upgrade-edge-3XX
spec:
  ...
  tolerations:
  # default tolerations
  - key: "CriticalAddonsOnly"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "true"
    effect: "NoExecute"
  - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane"
    operator: "Equal"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd"
    operator: "Equal"
    effect: "NoExecute"
  # custom toleration
  - key: "foo"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "bar"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
...
----
====

_Air-gapped:_

. *Mirror SUSE RPM repositories* - OS RPM repositories should be locally mirrored so that `os-pkg-update.service/os-migration.service` can have access to them. This can be achieved using link:https://github.com/SUSE/rmt[RMT].

=== Update procedure

[NOTE]
====
This section assumes you will be deploying the `OS upgrade` *SUC Plan* using <<components-fleet,Fleet>>. If you intend to deploy the *SUC Plan* using a different approach, refer to <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-third-party>>.
====

The `OS upgrade procedure` revolves around deploying *SUC Plans* to downstream clusters. These plans then hold information about how and on which nodes to deploy the `os-pkg-update.service/os-migration.service`. For information regarding the structure of a *SUC Plan*, refer to the https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller?tab=readme-ov-file#example-plans[upstream] documentation.

`OS upgrade` SUC Plans are shipped in the following ways:

* Through a `GitRepo` resources - <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-git-repo>>

* Through a `Bundle` resource - <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-bundle>>

To determine which resource you should use, refer to <<day2-determine-use-case>>.

For a full overview of what happens during the _upgrade procedure_, refer to the <<os-update-overview>> section.

[#os-update-overview]
==== Overview

This section aims to describe the full workflow that the *_OS upgrade process_* goes throught from start to finish.

.OS upgrade workflow
image::day2_os_pkg_update_diagram.png[]

OS upgrade steps:

. Based on his use-case, the user determines whether to use a *GitRepo* or a *Bundle* resource for the deployment of the `OS upgrade SUC Plans` to the desired downstream clusters. For information on how to map a *GitRepo/Bundle* to a specific set of downstream clusters, see https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-targets[Mapping to Downstream Clusters].

.. If you are unsure whether you should use a *GitRepo* or a *Bundle* resource for the *SUC Plan* deployment, refer to <<day2-determine-use-case>>.

.. For *GitRepo/Bundle* configuration options, refer to <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-git-repo>> or <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-bundle>>.

. The user deploys the configured *GitRepo/Bundle* resource to the `fleet-default` namespace in his `management cluster`. This is done either *manually* or thorugh the *Rancher UI* if such is available.

. <<components-fleet,Fleet>> constantly monitors the `fleet-default` namespace and immediately detects the newly deployed *GitRepo/Bundle* resource. For more information regarding what namespaces does Fleet monitor, refer to Fleet's https://fleet.rancher.io/namespaces[Namespaces] documentation.

. If the user has deployed a *GitRepo* resource, `Fleet` will reconcile the *GitRepo* and based on its *paths* and *fleet.yaml* configurations it will deploy a *Bundle* resource in the `fleet-default` namespace. For more information, refer to Fleet's https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-content[GitRepo Contents] documentation.

. `Fleet` then proceeds to deploy the `Kubernetes resources` from this *Bundle* to all the targeted `downstream clusters`. In the context of `OS upgrades`, Fleet deploys the following resources from the *Bundle*:

.. *Agent SUC Plan* - instructs *SUC* on how to do an OS upgrade on cluster *_agent_* nodes. Will *not* be interpreted if the cluster consists only from _control-plane_ nodes. Will execute after all control-plane *SUC* Plans have completed successfully.

.. *Control-plane SUC Plan* - instructs *SUC* on how to do an OS upgrade on cluster *_control-plane_* nodes.

.. *Script Secret* - referenced in each *SUC Plan*; ships an `upgrade.sh` script responsible for creating the `os-pkg-update.service/os-migration.service` which will do the actual OS upgrade.

.. *Script Data ConfigMap* - referenced in each *SUC Plan*; ships configurations used by the `upgrade.sh` script.
+
[NOTE]
====
The above resources will be deployed in the `cattle-system` namespace of each downstream cluster.
====

. On the downstream cluster, *SUC* picks up the newly deployed *SUC Plans* and deploys an *_Update Pod_* on each node that matches the *node selector* defined in the *SUC Plan*. For information how to monitor the *SUC Plan Pod*, refer to <<monitor-suc-plans>>.

. The *Update Pod* (deployed on each node) *mounts* the script Secret and *executes* the `upgrade.sh` script that the Secret ships.

. The `upgrade.sh` proceeds to do the following:

.. Based on its configurations, determine whether the OS needs a package update, or it needs to be migrated.

.. Based on the above outcome it will create either a `os-pkg-update.service` (for package updates), or a `os-migration.service` (for migration). The service will be of type *oneshot* and will adopt the following workflow:

... For `os-pkg-update.service`:

.... Update all package version on the node OS, by running `transactional-update cleanup up`

.... After a successful `transactional-update`, shedule a system *reboot* so that the package version updates can take effect

... For `os-migration.service`:

.... Update all package version on the node OS, by running `transactional-update cleanup up`. Done to ensure that no old package versions will cause an OS migration error

.... Proceed to migrate the OS to the desired values. Migration is done by utilising the `zypper migration` command.

.... Shedule a system *reboot* so that the migration can take effect

.. Start the `os-pkg-update.service/os-migration.service` and wait for it to complete

.. Cleanup the `os-pkg-update.service/os-migration.service` - after the *_systemd.service_* has done its job, it is removed from the system in order to ensure that no accidental executions/reboots happen in the future.

The OS upgrade procedure finishes with the *_system reboot_*. After the reboot the OS package versions will be upgraded and depending if the Edge release requires it, the OS might be migrated as well.

=== OS upgrade - SUC Plan deployment

This section describes how to orchestrate the deployment of *SUC Plans* related OS upgrades using Fleet's *GitRepo* and *Bundle* resources.

[#os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-git-repo]
==== SUC Plan deployment - GitRepo resource

A *GitRepo* resource, that ships the needed `OS upgrade` *SUC Plans*, can be deployed in one of the following ways:

. Through the `Rancher UI` - <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-git-repo-rancher>> (when `Rancher` is available).

. By <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-git-repo-manual, manually deploying>> the resource to your `management cluster`.

Once deployed, to monitor the OS upgrade process of the nodes of your targeted cluster, refer to the <<monitor-suc-plans>> documentation.

[#os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-git-repo-rancher]
===== GitRepo creation - Rancher UI

. In the upper left corner, *☰ -> Continuous Delivery*

. Go to *Git Repos -> Add Repository*

If you use the `suse-edge/fleet-examples` repository:

. *Repository URL* - `https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples.git`

. *Watch -> Revision* - choose a link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag for the `suse-edge/fleet-examples` repository that you wish to use

. Under *Paths* add the path to the OS upgrade Fleets that you wish to use - `fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/os-upgrade`

. Select *Next* to move to the *target* configuration section. *Only select clusters whose node's packages you wish to upgrade*

. *Create*

Alternatively, if you decide to use your own repository to host these files, you would need to provide your repo data above.

[#os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-git-repo-manual]
===== GitRepo creation - manual

. Choose the desired Edge link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag that you wish to apply the OS *SUC update Plans* from (referenced below as `$\{REVISION\}`).

. Pull the *GitRepo* resource:
+
[,bash]
----
curl -o os-update-gitrepo.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/${REVISION}/gitrepos/day2/os-update-gitrepo.yaml
----

. Edit the *GitRepo* configuration, under `spec.targets` specify your desired target list. By default the `GitRepo` resources from the `suse-edge/fleet-examples` are *NOT* mapped to any down stream clusters.

** To match all clusters change the default `GitRepo` *target* to:
+
[,yaml]
----
spec:
  targets:
  - clusterSelector: {}
----

** Alternatively, if you want a more granular cluster selection see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-targets[Mapping to Downstream Clusters]


. Apply the *GitRepo* resources to your `management cluster`:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f os-update-gitrepo.yaml
----

. View the created *GitRepo* resource under the `fleet-default` namespace:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get gitrepo os-upgrade -n fleet-default

# Example output

[#os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-bundle]
==== SUC Plan deployment - Bundle resource

A *Bundle* resource, that ships the needed `OS upgrade` *SUC Plans*, can be deployed in one of the following ways:

. Through the `Rancher UI` - <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-bundle-rancher>> (when `Rancher` is available).

. By <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-bundle-manual, manually deploying>> the resource to your `management cluster`.

Once deployed, to monitor the OS upgrade process of the nodes of your targeted cluster, refer to the <<monitor-suc-plans>> documentation.

[#os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-bundle-rancher]
===== Bundle creation - Rancher UI

. In the upper left corner, click *☰ -> Continuous Delivery*

. Go to *Advanced* > *Bundles*

. Select *Create from YAML*

. From here you can create the Bundle in one of the following ways:

.. By manually copying the *Bundle* content to the *Create from YAML* page. Content can be retrieved from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/$\{REVISION\}/bundles/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/os-upgrade/os-upgrade-bundle.yaml, where `$\{REVISION\}` is the Edge link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] that you are using

.. By cloning the link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples.git[suse-edge/fleet-examples] repository to the desired link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag and selecting the *Read from File* option in the *Create from YAML* page. From there, navigate to `bundles/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/os-upgrade` directory and select `os-upgrade-bundle.yaml`. This will auto-populate the *Create from YAML* page with the Bundle content.

. Change the *target* clusters for the `Bundle`:

** To match all downstream clusters change the default Bundle `.spec.targets` to:
+
[, yaml]
----
spec:
  targets:
  - clusterSelector: {}
----

** For a more granular downstream cluster mappings, see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-targets[Mapping to Downstream Clusters].

[#os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-third-party]
==== SUC Plan deployment - third-party GitOps workflow

There might be use-cases where users would like to incorporate the OS upgrade *SUC Plans* to their own third-party GitOps workflow (e.g. `Flux`).

To get the OS upgrade resources that you need, first determine the Edge link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag of the link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples.git[suse-edge/fleet-examples] repository that you would like to use.

After that, resources can be found at `fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/os-upgrade`, where:

* `plan-control-plane.yaml` - `system-upgrade-controller` Plan resource for *control-plane* nodes

* `plan-agent.yaml` - `system-upgrade-controller` Plan resource for *agent* nodes

* `secret.yaml` - secret that ships a script that creates the `os-pkg-update.service/os-migration.service` link:https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html[systemd.service]

[IMPORTANT]
====
These `Plan` resources are interpreted by the `system-upgrade-controller` and should be deployed on each downstream cluster that you wish to upgrade. For information on how to deploy the `system-upgrade-controller`, see <<day2-suc-third-party-gitops>>.
====

To better understand how your GitOps workflow can be used to deploy the *SUC Plans* for OS upgrade, it can be beneficial to take a look at the <<os-update-overview,overview>> of the update procedure using `Fleet`.
