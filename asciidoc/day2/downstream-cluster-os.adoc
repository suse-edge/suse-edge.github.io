=== Components

This section covers the custom components that the `OS upgrade` process uses over the default `Day 2` <<day2-downstream-components, components>>.

==== systemd.service

A different link:https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html[systemd.service] is created depending on what upgrade your OS requires from one Edge version to another:

* For Edge versions that require the same OS version (e.g. `6.0`), the `os-pkg-update.service` will be created. It uses the link:https://kubic.opensuse.org/documentation/man-pages/transactional-update.8.html[transactional-update] command to perform a link:https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Zypper_usage#Updating_packages[normal package upgrade].

* For Edge versions that require a OS version migration (e.g `5.5` -> `6.0`), the `os-migration.service` will be created. It uses link:https://kubic.opensuse.org/documentation/man-pages/transactional-update.8.html[transactional-update] to perform:

** First a link:https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Zypper_usage#Updating_packages[normal package upgrade]. Done in order to ensure that all packages are with the latest version before the migration. Mitigating any failures related to old package version.

** After that it proceeds with the OS migration process by utilizing the `zypper migration` command.

Shipped through a *SUC plan*, which should be located on each *downstream cluster* that is in need of an OS upgrade.

=== Requirements

_General:_

. *SCC registered machine* - All downstream cluster nodes should be registered to `https://scc.suse.com/`. This is needed so that the `os-pkg-update.service/os-migration.service` can successfully connect to the needed OS RPM repositories.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For Edge releases that require a new OS version (e.g Edge 3.1), make sure that your SCC key supports the migration to the new version (e.g. for Edge 3.1, the SCC key should support SLE Micro `5.5` -> `6.0` migration).
====

. *Make sure that SUC Plan tolerations match node tolerations* - If your Kubernetes cluster nodes have custom *taints*, make sure to add link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/[tolerations] for those taints in the *SUC Plans*. By default *SUC Plans* have tolerations only for *control-plane* nodes. Default tolerations include:

* _CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoExecute_

* _node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule_

* _node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd:NoExecute_
+
[NOTE]
====
Any additional tolerations must be added under the `.spec.tolerations` section of each Plan. *SUC Plans* related to the OS upgrade can be found in the link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples[suse-edge/fleet-examples] repository under `fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/os-upgrade`. *Make sure you use the Plans from a valid repository link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag.*

An example of defining custom tolerations for the *control-plane* SUC Plan, would look like this:
[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: upgrade.cattle.io/v1
kind: Plan
metadata:
  name: os-upgrade-control-plane
spec:
  ...
  tolerations:
  # default tolerations
  - key: "CriticalAddonsOnly"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "true"
    effect: "NoExecute"
  - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane"
    operator: "Equal"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd"
    operator: "Equal"
    effect: "NoExecute"
  # custom toleration
  - key: "foo"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "bar"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
...
----
====

_Air-gapped:_

. *Mirror SUSE RPM repositories* - OS RPM repositories should be locally mirrored so that `os-pkg-update.service/os-migration.service` can have access to them. This can be achieved by using either link:https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/book-rmt.html[RMT] or link:https://documentation.suse.com/suma/5.0/en/suse-manager/index.html[SUMA].

=== Update procedure

[NOTE]
====
This section assumes you will be deploying the `OS upgrade` *SUC Plan* using <<components-fleet,Fleet>>. If you intend to deploy the *SUC Plan* using a different approach, refer to <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-third-party>>.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
For environments previously upgraded using this procedure, users should ensure that *one* of the following steps is completed:

* `Remove any previously deployed SUC Plans related to older Edge release versions from the downstream cluster` - can be done by removing the desired _downstream_ cluster from the existing `GitRepo/Bundle` target configuration, or removing the `GitRepo/Bundle` resource altogether.

* `Reuse the existing GitRepo/Bundle resource` - can be done by pointing the resource's revision to a new tag that holds the correct fleets for the desired `suse-edge/fleet-examples` link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release].

This is done in order to avoid clashes between `SUC Plans` for older Edge release versions.

If users attempt to upgrade, while there are existing `SUC Plans` on the _downstream_ cluster, they will see the following fleet error:

[,bash]
----
Not installed: Unable to continue with install: Plan <plan_name> in namespace <plan_namespace> exists and cannot be imported into the current release: invalid ownership metadata; annotation validation error..
----
====

The `OS upgrade procedure` revolves around deploying *SUC Plans* to downstream clusters. These plans hold information about how and on which nodes to deploy the `os-pkg-update.service/os-migration.service`. For information regarding the structure of a *SUC Plan*, refer to the https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller?tab=readme-ov-file#example-plans[upstream] documentation.

`OS upgrade` SUC Plans are shipped in the following ways:

* Through a `GitRepo` resources - <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-git-repo>>

* Through a `Bundle` resource - <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-bundle>>

To determine which resource you should use, refer to <<day2-determine-use-case>>.

For a full overview of what happens during the _upgrade procedure_, refer to the <<os-update-overview>> section.

[#os-update-overview]
==== Overview

This section aims to describe the full workflow that the *_OS upgrade process_* goes through from start to finish.

.OS upgrade workflow
image::day2_os_pkg_update_diagram.png[]

OS upgrade steps:

. Based on their use-case, the user determines whether to use a *GitRepo* or a *Bundle* resource for the deployment of the `OS upgrade SUC Plans` to the desired downstream clusters. For information on how to map a *GitRepo/Bundle* to a specific set of downstream clusters, see https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-targets[Mapping to Downstream Clusters].

.. If you are unsure whether you should use a *GitRepo* or a *Bundle* resource for the *SUC Plan* deployment, refer to <<day2-determine-use-case>>.

.. For *GitRepo/Bundle* configuration options, refer to <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-git-repo>> or <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-bundle>>.

. The user deploys the configured *GitRepo/Bundle* resource to the `fleet-default` namespace in his `management cluster`. This is done either *manually* or through the *Rancher UI* if such is available.

. <<components-fleet,Fleet>> constantly monitors the `fleet-default` namespace and immediately detects the newly deployed *GitRepo/Bundle* resource. For more information regarding what namespaces does Fleet monitor, refer to Fleet's https://fleet.rancher.io/namespaces[Namespaces] documentation.

. If the user has deployed a *GitRepo* resource, `Fleet` will reconcile the *GitRepo* and based on its *paths* and *fleet.yaml* configurations it will deploy a *Bundle* resource in the `fleet-default` namespace. For more information, refer to Fleet's https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-content[GitRepo Contents] documentation.

. `Fleet` then proceeds to deploy the `Kubernetes resources` from this *Bundle* to all the targeted `downstream clusters`. In the context of `OS upgrades`, Fleet deploys the following resources from the *Bundle*:

.. *Worker SUC Plan* - instructs *SUC* on how to do an OS upgrade on cluster *_worker_* nodes.  It is *not* interpreted if the cluster consists only from _control-plane_ nodes. It executes after all control-plane *SUC* plans have completed successfully.

.. *Control Plane SUC Plan* - instructs *SUC* on how to do an OS upgrade on cluster *_control-plane_* nodes.

.. *Script Secret* - referenced in each *SUC Plan*; ships an `upgrade.sh` script responsible for creating the `os-pkg-update.service/os-migration.service` which will do the actual OS upgrade.

.. *Script Data ConfigMap* - referenced in each *SUC Plan*; ships configurations used by the `upgrade.sh` script.
+
[NOTE]
====
The above resources will be deployed in the `cattle-system` namespace of each downstream cluster.
====

. On the downstream cluster, *SUC* picks up the newly deployed *SUC Plans* and deploys an *_Update Pod_* on each node that matches the *node selector* defined in the *SUC Plan*. For information how to monitor the *SUC Plan Pod*, refer to <<components-system-upgrade-controller-monitor-plans>>.

. The *Update Pod* (deployed on each node) *mounts* the script Secret and *executes* the `upgrade.sh` script that the Secret ships.

. The `upgrade.sh` proceeds to do the following:

.. Based on its configurations, determine whether the OS needs a package update, or it needs to be migrated.

.. Based on the above outcome it will create either a `os-pkg-update.service` (for package updates), or a `os-migration.service` (for migration). The service will be of type *oneshot* and will adopt the following workflow:

... For `os-pkg-update.service`:

.... Update all package versions on the node OS, by running `transactional-update cleanup up`

.... After a successful `transactional-update`, schedule a system *reboot* so that the package version updates can take effect

... For `os-migration.service`:

.... Update all package versions on the node OS, by running `transactional-update cleanup up`. This is done to ensure that no old package versions cause an OS migration error.

.... Proceed to migrate the OS to the desired values. Migration is done by utilizing the `zypper migration` command.

.... Schedule a system *reboot* so that the migration can take effect

.. Start the `os-pkg-update.service/os-migration.service` and wait for it to complete.

.. Cleanup the `os-pkg-update.service/os-migration.service` after the *_systemd.service_* has done its job. It is removed from the system to ensure that no accidental executions/reboots happen in the future.

The OS upgrade procedure finishes with the *_system reboot_*. After the reboot, the OS package versions are upgraded and if the Edge release requires it, the OS might be migrated as well.

[#os-pkg-suc-plan-deployment]
=== OS upgrade - SUC Plan deployment

This section describes how to orchestrate the deployment of *SUC Plans* related OS upgrades using Fleet's *GitRepo* and *Bundle* resources.

[#os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-git-repo]
==== SUC Plan deployment - GitRepo resource

A *GitRepo* resource, that ships the needed `OS upgrade` *SUC Plans*, can be deployed in one of the following ways:

. Through the `Rancher UI` - <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-git-repo-rancher>> (when `Rancher` is available).

. By <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-git-repo-manual, manually deploying>> the resource to your `management cluster`.

Once deployed, to monitor the OS upgrade process of the nodes of your targeted cluster, refer to the <<components-system-upgrade-controller-monitor-plans>> documentation.

[#os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-git-repo-rancher]
===== GitRepo creation - Rancher UI

To create a `GitRepo` resource through the Rancher UI, follow their official link:https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/integrations-in-rancher/fleet/overview#accessing-fleet-in-the-rancher-ui[documentation].

The Edge team maintains a ready to use link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/tree/release-3.1.2/fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/os-upgrade[fleet] that users can add as a `path` for their GitRepo resource.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Always use this fleet from a valid Edge link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag.
====

For use-cases where no custom tolerations need to be included to the `SUC plans` that the fleet ships, users can directly refer the `os-upgrade` fleet from the `suse-edge/fleet-examples` repository.

In cases where custom tolerations are needed, users should refer the `os-upgrade` fleet from a separate repository, allowing them to add the tolerations to the SUC plans as required.

An example of how a `GitRepo` can be configured to use the fleet from the `suse-edge/fleet-examples` repository, can be viewed link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/blob/release-3.1.2/gitrepos/day2/os-upgrade-gitrepo.yaml[here].

[#os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-git-repo-manual]
===== GitRepo creation - manual

. Pull the *GitRepo* resource:
+
[,bash]
----
curl -o os-upgrade-gitrepo.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/refs/tags/release-3.1.2/gitrepos/day2/os-upgrade-gitrepo.yaml
----

. Edit the *GitRepo* configuration, under `spec.targets` specify your desired target list. By default the `GitRepo` resources from the `suse-edge/fleet-examples` are *NOT* mapped to any downstream clusters.

** To match all clusters change the default `GitRepo` *target* to:
+
[,yaml]
----
spec:
  targets:
  - clusterSelector: {}
----

** Alternatively, if you want a more granular cluster selection see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-targets[Mapping to Downstream Clusters]


. Apply the *GitRepo* resources to your `management cluster`:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f os-upgrade-gitrepo.yaml
----

. View the created *GitRepo* resource under the `fleet-default` namespace:
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl get gitrepo os-upgrade -n fleet-default

# Example output
NAME            REPO                                              COMMIT         BUNDLEDEPLOYMENTS-READY   STATUS

[#os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-bundle]
==== SUC Plan deployment - Bundle resource

A *Bundle* resource, that ships the needed `OS upgrade` *SUC Plans*, can be deployed in one of the following ways:

. Through the `Rancher UI` - <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-bundle-rancher>> (when `Rancher` is available).

. By <<os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-bundle-manual, manually deploying>> the resource to your `management cluster`.

Once deployed, to monitor the OS upgrade process of the nodes of your targeted cluster, refer to the <<components-system-upgrade-controller-monitor-plans>> documentation.

[#os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-bundle-rancher]
===== Bundle creation - Rancher UI

The Edge team maintains a ready to use link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/blob/release-3.1.2/bundles/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/os-upgrade/os-upgrade-bundle.yaml[bundle] that can be used in the below steps.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Always use this bundle from a valid Edge link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag.
====

To create a bundle through Rancher's UI:

. In the upper left corner, click *☰ -> Continuous Delivery*

. Go to *Advanced* > *Bundles*

. Select *Create from YAML*

. From here you can create the Bundle in one of the following ways:
+
[NOTE]
====
There might be use-cases where you would need to include custom tolerations to the `SUC plans` that the bundle ships. Make sure to include those tolerations in the bundle that will be generated by the below steps.
====

.. By manually copying the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/refs/tags/release-3.1.2/bundles/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/os-upgrade/os-upgrade-bundle.yaml[bundle content] from `suse-edge/fleet-examples` to the *Create from YAML* page.

.. By cloning the link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples.git[suse-edge/fleet-examples] repository from the desired link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag and selecting the *Read from File* option in the *Create from YAML* page. From there, navigate to the bundle location (`bundles/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/os-upgrade`) and select the bundle file. This will auto-populate the *Create from YAML* page with the bundle content.

. Change the *target* clusters for the `Bundle`:

** To match all downstream clusters change the default Bundle `.spec.targets` to:
+
[, yaml]
----
spec:
  targets:
  - clusterSelector: {}
----

** For a more granular downstream cluster mappings, see link:https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-targets[Mapping to Downstream Clusters].

[#os-upgrade-suc-plan-deployment-third-party]
==== SUC Plan deployment - third-party GitOps workflow

There might be use-cases where users would like to incorporate the OS upgrade *SUC Plans* to their own third-party GitOps workflow (e.g. `Flux`).

To get the OS upgrade resources that you need, first determine the Edge link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag of the link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples.git[suse-edge/fleet-examples] repository that you would like to use.

After that, resources can be found at `fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/os-upgrade`, where:

* `plan-control-plane.yaml` - `system-upgrade-controller` Plan resource for *control-plane* nodes.

* `plan-worker.yaml` - `system-upgrade-controller` Plan resource for *worker* nodes.

* `secret.yaml` - secret that ships the `upgrade.sh` script.

* `config-map.yaml` - ConfigMap that provides upgrade configurations that are consumed by the `upgrade.sh` script.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These `Plan` resources are interpreted by the `system-upgrade-controller` and should be deployed on each downstream cluster that you wish to upgrade. For information on how to deploy the `system-upgrade-controller`, see <<components-system-upgrade-controller-install>>.
====

To better understand how your GitOps workflow can be used to deploy the *SUC Plans* for OS upgrade, it can be beneficial to take a look at the <<os-update-overview,overview>> of the update procedure using `Fleet`.
