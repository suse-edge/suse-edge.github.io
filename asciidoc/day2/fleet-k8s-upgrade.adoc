[IMPORTANT]
====
This section covers Kubernetes upgrades for downstream clusters that have *NOT* been created through a <<components-rancher,Rancher>> instance. For information on how to upgrade the Kubernetes version of `Rancher` created clusters, see link:https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/{rancher-docs-version}/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/upgrade-and-roll-back-kubernetes#upgrading-the-kubernetes-version[Upgrading and Rolling Back Kubernetes].
====
endif::[]

This section describes how to perform a Kubernetes upgrade using <<components-fleet>> and the <<components-system-upgrade-controller>>.

The following topics are covered as part of this section:

. <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-components>> - additional components used by the upgrade process.
. <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-overview>> - overview of the upgrade process.
. <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-requirements>> - requirements of the upgrade process.
. <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-plan-deployment>> - information on how to deploy `SUC plans`, responsible for triggering the upgrade process.

[#{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-components]
=== Components

This section covers the custom components that the `K8s upgrade` process uses over the default "Day 2" <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-components, components>>.

[#{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-components-rke2-upgrade]
==== rke2-upgrade

Container image responsible for upgrading the RKE2 version of a specific node.

Shipped through a Pod created by *SUC* based on a *SUC Plan*. The Plan should be located on each *cluster* that is in need of a RKE2 upgrade.

For more information regarding how the `rke2-upgrade` image performs the upgrade, see the link:https://github.com/rancher/rke2-upgrade/tree/master[upstream] documentation.

[#{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-components-k3s-upgrade]
==== k3s-upgrade

Container image responsible for upgrading the K3s version of a specific node.

Shipped through a Pod created by *SUC* based on a *SUC Plan*. The Plan should be located on each *cluster* that is in need of a K3s upgrade.

For more information regarding how the `k3s-upgrade` image performs the upgrade, see the link:https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-upgrade[upstream] documentation.

[#{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-overview]
=== Overview

The Kubernetes distribution upgrade for {cluster-type} cluster nodes is done by utilizing `Fleet` and the `System Upgrade Controller (SUC)`.

`Fleet` is used to deploy and manage `SUC plans` onto the desired cluster.

[NOTE]
====
`SUC plans` are link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[custom resources] that describe the steps that *SUC* needs to follow in order for a specific task to be executed on a set of nodes. For an example of how an `SUC plan` looks like, refer to the link:https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller?tab=readme-ov-file#example-plans[upstream repository].
====

The `K8s SUC plans` are shipped on each cluster by deploying a https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-add[GitRepo] or https://fleet.rancher.io/bundle-add[Bundle] resource to a specific Fleet link:https://fleet.rancher.io/namespaces#gitrepos-bundles-clusters-clustergroups[workspace]. Fleet retrieves the deployed `GitRepo/Bundle` and deploys its contents (the `K8s SUC plans`) to the desired cluster(s).

[NOTE]
====
`GitRepo/Bundle` resources are always deployed on the `management cluster`. Whether to use a `GitRepo` or `Bundle` resource depends on your use-case, check <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-determine-use-case>> for more information.
====

`K8s SUC plans` describe the following workflow:

. Always link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_cordon/[cordon] the nodes before K8s upgrades.

. Always upgrade `control-plane` nodes before `worker` nodes.

. Always upgrade the `control-plane` nodes *one* node at a time and the `worker` nodes *two* nodes at a time.

Once the `K8s SUC plans` are deployed, the workflow looks like this:

. SUC reconciles the deployed `K8s SUC plans` and creates a `Kubernetes Job` on *each node*.

. Depending on the Kubernetes distribution, the Job will create a Pod that runs either the <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-components-rke2-upgrade, `rke2-upgrade`>> or the <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-components-k3s-upgrade, `k3s-upgrade`>> container image.

. The created Pod will go through the following workflow:

.. Replace the existing `rke2/k3s` binary on the node with the one from the `rke2-upgrade/k3s-upgrade` image.

.. Kill the running `rke2/k3s` process.

. Killing the `rke2/k3s` process triggers a restart, launching a new process that runs the updated binary, resulting in an upgraded Kubernetes distribution version.

Below you can find a diagram of the above description:

image::fleet-day2-{cluster-type}-k8s-upgrade.png[scaledwidth=100%]

[#{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-requirements]
=== Requirements

. *Backup your Kubernetes distribution:*

.. For *RKE2 clusters*, see the link:https://docs.rke2.io/datastore/backup_restore[RKE2 Backup and Restore] documentation.

.. For *K3s clusters*, see the link:https://docs.k3s.io/datastore/backup-restore[K3s Backup and Restore] documentation.

. *Make sure that SUC Plan tolerations match node tolerations* - If your Kubernetes cluster nodes have custom *taints*, make sure to add link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/[tolerations] for those taints in the *SUC Plans*. By default *SUC Plans* have tolerations only for *control-plane* nodes. Default tolerations include: 

* _CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoExecute_

* _node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule_

* _node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd:NoExecute_
+
[NOTE]
====
Any additional tolerations must be added under the `.spec.tolerations` section of each Plan. *SUC Plans* related to the Kubernetes version upgrade can be found in the link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples[suse-edge/fleet-examples] repository under:

* For *RKE2* - `fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/rke2-upgrade`
* For *K3s*  - `fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/k3s-upgrade`

*Make sure you use the Plans from a valid repository link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag.*

An example of defining custom tolerations for the RKE2 *control-plane* SUC Plan, would look like this:
[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: upgrade.cattle.io/v1
kind: Plan
metadata:
  name: rke2-upgrade-control-plane
spec:
  ...
  tolerations:
  # default tolerations
  - key: "CriticalAddonsOnly"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "true"
    effect: "NoExecute"
  - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane"
    operator: "Equal"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd"
    operator: "Equal"
    effect: "NoExecute"
  # custom toleration
  - key: "foo"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "bar"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
...
----

[#{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-plan-deployment]
=== K8s upgrade - SUC plan deployment

[IMPORTANT]
====
For environments previously upgraded using this procedure, users should ensure that *one* of the following steps is completed:

* `Remove any previously deployed SUC Plans related to older Edge release versions from the {cluster-type} cluster` - can be done by removing the desired cluster from the existing `GitRepo/Bundle` link:https://fleet.rancher.io/gitrepo-targets#target-matching[target configuration], or removing the `GitRepo/Bundle` resource altogether.

* `Reuse the existing GitRepo/Bundle resource` - can be done by pointing the resource's revision to a new tag that holds the correct fleets for the desired `suse-edge/fleet-examples` link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release].

This is done in order to avoid clashes between `SUC Plans` for older Edge release versions.

If users attempt to upgrade, while there are existing `SUC Plans` on the {cluster-type} cluster, they will see the following fleet error:

[,bash]
----
Not installed: Unable to continue with install: Plan <plan_name> in namespace <plan_namespace> exists and cannot be imported into the current release: invalid ownership metadata; annotation validation error..
----
====

As mentioned in <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-overview>>, Kubernetes upgrades are done by shipping `SUC plans` to the desired cluster through one of the following ways:

* <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-plan-deployment-gitrepo, Fleet `GitRepo` resource>>

* <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-plan-deployment-bundle, Fleet `Bundle` resource>>

To determine which resource you should use, refer to <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-determine-use-case>>.

For use-cases where you wish to deploy the `K8s SUC plans` from a third-party GitOps tool, refer to <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-plan-deployment-third-party>>

[#{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-plan-deployment-gitrepo]
==== SUC plan deployment - GitRepo resource

A *GitRepo* resource, that ships the needed `K8s SUC plans`, can be deployed in one of the following ways:

. Through the `Rancher UI` - <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-plan-deployment-gitrepo-rancher>> (when `Rancher` is available).

. By <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-plan-deployment-gitrepo-manual, manually deploying>> the resource to your `management cluster`.

Once deployed, to monitor the Kubernetes upgrade process of the nodes of your targeted cluster, refer to <<components-system-upgrade-controller-monitor-plans>>.

[#{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-plan-deployment-gitrepo-rancher]
===== GitRepo creation - Rancher UI

To create a `GitRepo` resource through the Rancher UI, follow their official link:https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/{rancher-docs-version}/integrations-in-rancher/fleet/overview#accessing-fleet-in-the-rancher-ui[documentation].

The Edge team maintains ready to use fleets for both link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/tree/{release-tag-fleet-examples}/fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/rke2-upgrade[rke2] and link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/tree/{release-tag-fleet-examples}/fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/k3s-upgrade[k3s] Kubernetes distributions. Depending on your environment, this fleet could be used directly or as a template.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Always use these fleets from a valid Edge link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag.
====

For use-cases where no custom changes need to be included to the `SUC plans` that these fleets ship, users can directly refer the fleets from the `suse-edge/fleet-examples` repository.

In cases where custom changes are needed (e.g. to add custom tolerations), users should refer the fleets from a separate repository, allowing them to add the changes to the SUC plans as required.

Configuration examples for a `GitRepo` resource using the fleets from `suse-edge/fleet-examples` repository:

* link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/blob/{release-tag-fleet-examples}/gitrepos/day2/rke2-upgrade-gitrepo.yaml[RKE2]

==== SUC plan deployment - Bundle resource

A *Bundle* resource, that ships the needed `Kubernetes upgrade SUC Plans`, can be deployed in one of the following ways:

. Through the `Rancher UI` - <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-plan-deployment-bundle-rancher>> (when `Rancher` is available).

. By <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-plan-deployment-bundle-manual, manually deploying>> the resource to your `management cluster`.

[#{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-plan-deployment-bundle-rancher]
===== Bundle creation - Rancher UI

The Edge team maintains ready to use bundles for both link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/blob/{release-tag-fleet-examples}/bundles/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/rke2-upgrade/plan-bundle.yaml[rke2] and link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/blob/{release-tag-fleet-examples}/bundles/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/k3s-upgrade/plan-bundle.yaml[k3s] Kubernetes distributions. Depending on your environment these bundles could be used directly or as a template.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Always use this bundle from a valid Edge link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag.
====

To create a bundle through Rancher's UI:

. In the upper left corner, click *☰ -> Continuous Delivery*

. Go to *Advanced* > *Bundles*

. Select *Create from YAML*

. From here you can create the Bundle in one of the following ways:
+
[NOTE]
====
There might be use-cases where you would need to include custom changes to the `SUC plans` that the bundle ships (e.g. to add custom tolerations). Make sure to include those changes in the bundle that will be generated by the below steps.
====

.. By manually copying the bundle content for link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/refs/tags/{release-tag-fleet-examples}/bundles/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/rke2-upgrade/plan-bundle.yaml[RKE2] or link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/refs/tags/{release-tag-fleet-examples}/bundles/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/k3s-upgrade/plan-bundle.yaml[K3s] from `suse-edge/fleet-examples` to the *Create from YAML* page.

.. By cloning the link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples.git[suse-edge/fleet-examples] repository from the desired link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag and selecting the *Read from File* option in the *Create from YAML* page. From there, navigate to the bundle that you need (`bundles/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/rke2-upgrade/plan-bundle.yaml` for RKE2 and `bundles/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/k3s-upgrade/plan-bundle.yaml` for K3s). This will auto-populate the *Create from YAML* page with the bundle content.

[#{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-plan-deployment-third-party]
==== SUC Plan deployment - third-party GitOps workflow

There might be use-cases where users would like to incorporate the `Kubernetes upgrade SUC plans` to their own third-party GitOps workflow (e.g. `Flux`).

To get the K8s upgrade resources that you need, first determine the Edge link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases[release] tag of the link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples.git[suse-edge/fleet-examples] repository that you would like to use.

After that, the resources can be found at:

* For a RKE2 cluster upgrade:

** For `control-plane` nodes - `fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/rke2-upgrade/plan-control-plane.yaml`

** For `worker` nodes - `fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/rke2-upgrade/plan-worker.yaml`

* For a K3s cluster upgrade:

** For `control-plane` nodes - `fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/k3s-upgrade/plan-control-plane.yaml`

** For `worker` nodes - `fleets/day2/system-upgrade-controller-plans/k3s-upgrade/plan-worker.yaml`

[IMPORTANT]
====
These `Plan` resources are interpreted by the `System Upgrade Controller` and should be deployed on each downstream cluster that you wish to upgrade. For SUC deployment information, see <<components-system-upgrade-controller-install>>.
====

To better understand how your GitOps workflow can be used to deploy the *SUC Plans* for Kubernetes version upgrade, it can be beneficial to take a look at the <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet-k8s-upgrade-overview,overview>> of the update procedure using `Fleet`.
