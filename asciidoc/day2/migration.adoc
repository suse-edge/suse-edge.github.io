This section explains how to migrate your `management` and `downstream` clusters from `Edge {previous-edge-version}` to `Edge {static-edge-version}`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Always perform cluster migrations from the `latest Z-stream` release of `Edge {previous-edge-version}`.

Always migrate to the `Edge {static-edge-version}` release. For subsequent post-migration upgrades, refer to the <<day2-mgmt-cluster, management>> and <<day2-downstream-clusters, downstream>> cluster sections.

[#day2-migration-mgmt]
== Management Cluster
:cluster-type: management

This section covers the following topics:

<<day2-migration-mgmt-prereq>> - prerequisite steps to complete before starting the migration.

<<day2-migration-mgmt-upgrade-controller>> - how to do a `{cluster-type}` cluster migration using the <<components-upgrade-controller>>.

<<day2-migration-mgmt-fleet>> - how to do a `{cluster-type}` cluster migration using <<components-fleet>>.

[#day2-migration-mgmt-prereq]
=== Prerequisites

==== Upgrade the Bare Metal Operator CRDs

[NOTE]
====
Applies only to clusters that require a <<components-metal3>> chart upgrade.
====

The `Metal^3^` Helm chart includes the link:https://book.metal3.io/bmo/introduction.html[Bare Metal Operator (BMO)] CRDs by leveraging Helm's link:https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/#method-1-let-helm-do-it-for-you[CRD] directory.

However, this approach has certain limitations, particularly the inability to upgrade CRDs in this directory using Helm. For more information, refer to the link:https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/#some-caveats-and-explanations[Helm documentation].

As a result, before upgrading Metal^3^ to an `Edge {static-edge-version}` compatible version, users must manually upgrade the underlying BMO CRDs.

On a machine with `Helm` installed and `kubectl` configured to point to your `{cluster-type}` cluster:

. Manually apply the BMO CRDs:
+
[,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
helm show crds oci://registry.suse.com/edge/charts/metal3 --version {version-metal3-chart} | kubectl apply -f -
----

[#day2-migration-mgmt-upgrade-controller]
=== Upgrade Controller

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `Upgrade Controller` currently supports Edge release migrations only for *non air-gapped management* clusters.
====

The following topics are covered as part of this section:

<<day2-migration-mgmt-upgrade-controller-prereq>> - prerequisites specific to the `Upgrade Controller`.

<<day2-migration-mgmt-upgrade-controller-migration>> - steps for migrating a `{cluster-type}` cluster to a new Edge version using the `Upgrade Controller`.

[#day2-migration-mgmt-upgrade-controller-prereq]
==== Prerequisites

===== Edge 3.3 Upgrade Controller

Before using the `Upgrade Controller`, you must first ensure that it is running a version that is capable of migrating to the desired Edge release.

To do this:

. If you already have `Upgrade Controller` deployed from a previous Edge release, upgrade its chart:
+
[,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
helm upgrade upgrade-controller -n upgrade-controller-system oci://registry.suse.com/edge/charts/upgrade-controller --version {version-upgrade-controller-chart}
----

. If you do *not* have `Upgrade Controller` deployed, follow <<components-upgrade-controller-installation>>.

[#day2-migration-mgmt-upgrade-controller-migration]
==== Migration steps

Performing a `{cluster-type}` cluster migration with the `Upgrade Controller` is fundamentally similar to executing an upgrade.

The only difference is that your `UpgradePlan` *must* specify the `{static-edge-version}` release version:

[,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
apiVersion: lifecycle.suse.com/v1alpha1
kind: UpgradePlan
metadata:
  name: upgrade-plan-mgmt
  # Change to the namespace of your Upgrade Controller
  namespace: CHANGE_ME
spec:
  releaseVersion: {static-edge-version}
----

For information on how to use the above `UpgradePlan` to do a migration, refer to <<{cluster-type}-day2-upgrade-controller, Upgrade Controller upgrade process>>.

[#day2-migration-mgmt-fleet]
=== Fleet

[NOTE]
====
Whenever possible, use the <<day2-migration-mgmt-upgrade-controller>> for migration.

Refer to this section only for use cases not covered by the `Upgrade Controller`.
====

Performing a `{cluster-type}` cluster migration with `Fleet` is fundamentally similar to executing an upgrade.

The *key* differences being that:

. The fleets *must be used* from the link:https://github.com/suse-edge/fleet-examples/releases/tag/{static-fleet-examples-tag}[{static-fleet-examples-tag}] release of the `suse-edge/fleet-examples` repository.

. Charts scheduled for an upgrade *must* be upgraded to versions compatible with the `Edge {static-edge-version}` release. For a list of the `Edge {static-edge-version}` components, refer to <<release-notes-3-3-0>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure a successful `Edge {static-edge-version}` migration, it is important that users comply with the points outlined above.
====

Considering the points above, users can follow the `{cluster-type}` cluster <<{cluster-type}-day2-fleet, Fleet>> documentation for a comprehensive guide on the steps required to perform a migration.
