SUSE Edge for Telco (formerly known as Adaptive Telco Infrastructure Platform/ATIP) is a Telco-optimized edge computing platform that enables telecom companies to innovate and accelerate the modernization of their networks.

SUSE Edge for Telco is a complete Telco cloud stack for hosting CNFs such as 5G Packet Core and Cloud RAN.

- Automates zero-touch rollout and lifecycle management of complex edge stack configurations at Telco scale.
- Continuously assures quality on Telco-grade hardware, using Telco-specific configurations and workloads.
- Consists of components that are purpose-built for the edge and hence have smaller footprint and higher performance per Watt.
- Maintains a flexible platform strategy with vendor-neutral APIs and 100% open source.
