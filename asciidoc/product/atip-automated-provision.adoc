=== Introduction

Directed network provisioning is a feature that allows you to automate the provisioning of downstream clusters. This feature is useful when you have many downstream clusters to provision, and you want to automate the process.

A <<atip-management-cluster,management cluster>> automates deployment of the following components:

* `SUSE Linux Micro RT` as the OS. Depending on the use case, configurations like networking, storage, users and kernel arguments can be customized.
* `RKE2` as the Kubernetes cluster. The default `CNI` plug-in is `Cilium`. Depending on the use case, certain `CNI` plug-ins can be used, such as `Cilium+Multus`.
* `SUSE Storage`
* `SUSE Security`
* `MetalLB` can be used as the load balancer for highly available multi-node clusters.

[NOTE]

[#single-node]

[#eib-edge-image-connected]
=== Prepare downstream cluster image for connected scenarios

<<components-eib, Edge Image Builder>> is used to prepare a modified SLEMicro base image which is provisioned on downstream cluster hosts.

Much of the configuration via Edge Image Builder is possible, but in this guide, we cover the minimal configurations necessary to set up the downstream cluster.

==== Prerequisites for connected scenarios

* A container runtime such as https://podman.io[Podman] or https://rancherdesktop.io[Rancher Desktop] is required to run Edge Image Builder.
* The base image will be built using the following guide <<guides-kiwi-builder-images>> with the profile `Base-SelfInstall` (or `Base-RT-SelfInstall` for the Real-Time kernel). The process is the same for both architectures (x86-64 and aarch64).

[NOTE]
====
It is required to use a build host with the same architecture of the images being built. In other words, to build an `aarch64` image, it is required to use an `aarch64` build host, and vice-versa for `x86-64` (cross-builds are not supported at this time).
====

==== Image configuration for connected scenarios

When running Edge Image Builder, a directory is mounted from the host, so it is necessary to create a directory structure to store the configuration files used to define the target image.

* `downstream-cluster-config.yaml` is the image definition file, see <<quickstart-eib>> for more details.
* The base image folder will contain the output raw image generated following the guide <<guides-kiwi-builder-images>> with the profile `Base-SelfInstall` (or `Base-RT-SelfInstall` for the Real-Time kernel) must be copied/moved under the `base-images` folder.
* The `network` folder is optional, see <<add-network-eib>> for more details.
* The `custom/scripts` directory contains scripts to be run on first-boot:
    1. `01-fix-growfs.sh` script is required to resize the OS root partition on deployment
    2. `02-performance.sh` script is optional and can be used to configure the system for performance tuning.
    3. `03-sriov.sh` script is optional and can be used to configure the system for SR-IOV.
* The `custom/files` directory contains the `performance-settings.sh` and `sriov-auto-filler.sh` files to be copied to the image during the image creation process.

===== Downstream cluster image definition file

The `downstream-cluster-config.yaml` file is the main configuration file for the downstream cluster image. The following is a minimal example for deployment via Metal^3^:

[,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {version-eib-api-latest}
image:
  imageType: raw
  arch: x86_64
  baseImage: {micro-base-image-raw}
  outputImageName: eibimage-output-telco.raw
operatingSystem:
  kernelArgs:
    - ignition.platform.id=openstack
    - net.ifnames=1
  systemd:
    disable:
      - rebootmgr
      - transactional-update.timer
      - transactional-update-cleanup.timer
      - fstrim
      - time-sync.target
  users:
    - username: root
      encryptedPassword: $ROOT_PASSWORD
      sshKeys:
      - $USERKEY1
  packages:
    packageList:
      - jq
    sccRegistrationCode: $SCC_REGISTRATION_CODE
----

Where `$SCC_REGISTRATION_CODE` is the registration code copied from https://scc.suse.com/[SUSE Customer Center], and the package list contains `jq` which is required.

`$ROOT_PASSWORD` is the encrypted password for the root user, which can be useful for test/debugging.  It can be generated with the `openssl passwd -6 PASSWORD` command

For the production environments, it is recommended to use the SSH keys that can be added to the users block replacing the `$USERKEY1` with the real SSH keys.

[NOTE]
====
`arch: x86_64` is the architecture of the image. For arm64 architecture, use `arch: aarch64`.

`net.ifnames=1` enables https://documentation.suse.com/smart/network/html/network-interface-predictable-naming/index.html[Predictable Network Interface Naming]

This matches the default configuration for the metal3 chart, but the setting must match the configured chart `predictableNicNames` value.

Also note `ignition.platform.id=openstack` is mandatory, without this argument SLEMicro configuration via ignition will fail in the Metal^3^ automated flow.
====

[#add-custom-script-growfs]
===== Growfs script

Currently, a custom script (`custom/scripts/01-fix-growfs.sh`) is required to grow the file system to match the disk size on first-boot after provisioning. The `01-fix-growfs.sh` script contains the following information:

[,shell]
----
#!/bin/bash
growfs() {
  mnt="$1"
  dev="$(findmnt --fstab --target ${mnt} --evaluate --real --output SOURCE --noheadings)"
  # /dev/sda3 -> /dev/sda, /dev/nvme0n1p3 -> /dev/nvme0n1
  parent_dev="/dev/$(lsblk --nodeps -rno PKNAME "${dev}")"
  # Last number in the device name: /dev/nvme0n1p42 -> 42
  partnum="$(echo "${dev}" | sed 's/^.*[^0-9]\([0-9]\+\)$/\1/')"
  ret=0
  growpart "$parent_dev" "$partnum" || ret=$?
  [ $ret -eq 0 ] || [ $ret -eq 1 ] || exit 1
  /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-growfs "$mnt"
}
growfs /
----

[#add-custom-script-performance]
===== Performance script

The following optional script (`custom/scripts/02-performance.sh`) can be used to configure the system for performance tuning:

[,shell]
----
#!/bin/bash

# create the folder to extract the artifacts there
mkdir -p /opt/performance-settings

# copy the artifacts
cp performance-settings.sh /opt/performance-settings/
----

The content of `custom/files/performance-settings.sh` is a script that can be used to configure the system for performance tuning and can be downloaded from the following {link-telco-cloud-performance-settings}[link].

[#add-custom-script-sriov]
===== SR-IOV script

The following optional script (`custom/scripts/03-sriov.sh`) can be used to configure the system for SR-IOV:

[,shell]
----
#!/bin/bash

# create the folder to extract the artifacts there
mkdir -p /opt/sriov
# copy the artifacts
cp sriov-auto-filler.sh /opt/sriov/sriov-auto-filler.sh
----

The content of `custom/files/sriov-auto-filler.sh` is a script that can be used to configure the system for SR-IOV and can be downloaded from the following {link-telco-cloud-sriov-auto-filler}[link].

[NOTE]
====
Add your own custom scripts to be executed during the provisioning process using the same approach.
For more information, see <<quickstart-eib>>.

====

[#add-telco-feature-eib]
===== Additional configuration for Telco workloads

To enable Telco features like `dpdk`, `sr-iov` or `FEC`, additional packages may be required as shown in the following example.

[,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {version-eib-api-latest}
image:
  imageType: raw
  arch: x86_64
  baseImage: {micro-base-image-raw}
  outputImageName: eibimage-output-telco.raw
operatingSystem:
  kernelArgs:
    - ignition.platform.id=openstack
    - net.ifnames=1
  systemd:
    disable:
      - rebootmgr
      - transactional-update.timer
      - transactional-update-cleanup.timer
      - fstrim
      - time-sync.target
  users:
    - username: root
      encryptedPassword: $ROOT_PASSWORD

      - dpdk-tools
      - libdpdk-23
      - pf-bb-config
    sccRegistrationCode: $SCC_REGISTRATION_CODE
----

Where `$SCC_REGISTRATION_CODE` is the registration code copied from https://scc.suse.com/[SUSE Customer Center], and the package list contains the minimum packages to be used for the Telco profiles.

[NOTE]
====
`arch: x86_64` is the architecture of the image. For arm64 architecture, use `arch: aarch64`.
====

[#add-network-eib]
===== Additional script for Advanced Network Configuration

If you need to configure static IPs or more advanced networking scenarios as described in <<advanced-network-configuration>>, the following additional configuration is required.

In the `network` folder, create the following `configure-network.sh` file - this consumes configuration drive data on first-boot, and configures the
host networking using the https://github.com/suse-edge/nm-configurator[NM Configurator tool].

[,shell]
----
#!/bin/bash

set -eux

# Attempt to statically configure a NIC in the case where we find a network_data.json
# In a configuration drive

CONFIG_DRIVE=$(blkid --label config-2 || true)
if [ -z "${CONFIG_DRIVE}" ]; then
  echo "No config-2 device found, skipping network configuration"
  exit 0
fi

mount -o ro $CONFIG_DRIVE /mnt

NETWORK_DATA_FILE="/mnt/openstack/latest/network_data.json"

if [ ! -f "${NETWORK_DATA_FILE}" ]; then
  umount /mnt
  echo "No network_data.json found, skipping network configuration"
  exit 0
fi

DESIRED_HOSTNAME=$(cat /mnt/openstack/latest/meta_data.json | tr ',{}' '\n' | grep '\"metal3-name\"' | sed 's/.*\"metal3-name\": \"\(.*\)\"/\1/')
echo "${DESIRED_HOSTNAME}" > /etc/hostname

mkdir -p /tmp/nmc/{desired,generated}
cp ${NETWORK_DATA_FILE} /tmp/nmc/desired/_all.yaml
umount /mnt

./nmc generate --config-dir /tmp/nmc/desired --output-dir /tmp/nmc/generated
./nmc apply --config-dir /tmp/nmc/generated
----

==== Image creation

Once the directory structure is prepared following the previous sections, run the following command to build the image:

[,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
podman run --rm --privileged -it -v $PWD:/eib \
 registry.suse.com/edge/{version-edge-registry}/edge-image-builder:{version-eib} \
 build --definition-file downstream-cluster-config.yaml
----

This creates the output ISO image file named `eibimage-output-telco.raw`, based on the definition described above.

The output image must then be made available via a webserver, either the media-server container enabled via the <<metal3-media-server,Management Cluster Documentation>>
or some other locally accessible server.  In the examples below, we refer to this server as `imagecache.local:8080`

[#eib-edge-image-airgap]
=== Prepare downstream cluster image for air-gap scenarios

<<components-eib, Edge Image Builder>> is used to prepare a modified SLEMicro base image which is provisioned on downstream cluster hosts.

Much of the configuration is possible with Edge Image Builder, but in this guide, we cover the minimal configurations necessary to set up the downstream cluster for air-gap scenarios.

==== Prerequisites for air-gap scenarios

* A container runtime such as https://podman.io[Podman] or https://rancherdesktop.io[Rancher Desktop] is required to run Edge Image Builder.
* The base image will be built using the following guide <<guides-kiwi-builder-images>> with the profile `Base-SelfInstall` (or `Base-RT-SelfInstall` for the Real-Time kernel). The process is the same for both architectures (x86-64 and aarch64).
* If you want to use SR-IOV or any other workload which require a container image, a local private registry must be deployed and already configured (with/without TLS and/or authentication). This registry will be used to store the images and the helm chart OCI images.

[NOTE]
====
It is required to use a build host with the same architecture of the images being built. In other words, to build an `aarch64` image, it is required to use an `aarch64` build host, and vice-versa for `x86-64` (cross-builds are not supported at this time).
====

==== Image configuration for air-gap scenarios

When running Edge Image Builder, a directory is mounted from the host, so it is necessary to create a directory structure to store the configuration files used to define the target image.

* `downstream-cluster-airgap-config.yaml` is the image definition file, see <<quickstart-eib>> for more details.
* The base image folder will contain the output raw image generated following the guide <<guides-kiwi-builder-images>> with the profile `Base-SelfInstall` (or `Base-RT-SelfInstall` for the Real-Time kernel) must be copied/moved under the `base-images` folder.
* The `network` folder is optional, see <<add-network-eib>> for more details.
* The `custom/scripts` directory contains scripts to be run on first-boot:
    1. `01-fix-growfs.sh` script is required to resize the OS root partition on deployment.
    2. `02-airgap.sh` script is required to copy the images to the right place during the image creation process for air-gapped environments.
    3. `03-performance.sh` script is optional and can be used to configure the system for performance tuning.
    4. `04-sriov.sh` script is optional and can be used to configure the system for SR-IOV.
* The `custom/files` directory contains the `rke2` and the `cni` images to be copied to the image during the image creation process. Also, the optional `performance-settings.sh` and `sriov-auto-filler.sh` files can be included.

[#preload-private-registry]
===== Preload your private registry with images required for air-gap scenarios and SR-IOV (optional)

If you want to use SR-IOV in your air-gap scenario or any other workload images, you must preload your local private registry with the images following the next steps:

* Download, extract, and push the helm-chart OCI images to the private registry
* Download, extract, and push the rest of images required to the private registry

The following scripts can be used to download, extract, and push the images to the private registry. We will show an example to preload the SR-IOV images, but you can also use the same approach to preload any other custom images:

. Preload with helm-chart OCI images for SR-IOV:

This creates the output ISO image file named `eibimage-output-telco.raw`, based on the definition described above.

The output image must then be made available via a webserver, either the media-server container enabled via the <<metal3-media-server,Management Cluster Documentation>>
or some other locally accessible server.  In the examples below, we refer to this server as `imagecache.local:8080`.


[#single-node]
=== Downstream cluster provisioning with Directed network provisioning (single-node)

This section describes the workflow used to automate the provisioning of a single-node downstream cluster using directed network provisioning.
This is the simplest way to automate the provisioning of a downstream cluster.

*Requirements*

- The image generated using `EIB`, as described in the xref:eib-edge-image-connected[previous section], with the minimal configuration to set up the downstream cluster has to be located in the management cluster exactly on the path you configured on xref:metal3-media-server[this section].
- The management server created and available to be used on the following sections. For more information, refer to the Management Cluster section <<atip-management-cluster>>.

*Workflow*

The following diagram shows the workflow used to automate the provisioning of a single-node downstream cluster using directed network provisioning:

image::atip-automated-singlenode1.png[scaledwidth=100%]

There are two different steps to automate the provisioning of a single-node downstream cluster using directed network provisioning:

1. Enroll the bare-metal host to make it available for the provisioning process.
2. Provision the bare-metal host to install and configure the operating system and the Kubernetes cluster.

[#enroll-bare-metal-host]
*Enroll the bare-metal host*

The first step is to enroll the new bare-metal host in the management cluster to make it available to be provisioned.
To do that, the following file (`bmh-example.yaml`) has to be created in the management cluster, to specify the `BMC` credentials to be used and the `BaremetalHost` object to be enrolled:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: example-demo-credentials
type: Opaque
data:
  username: ${BMC_USERNAME}
  password: ${BMC_PASSWORD}
---
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
kind: BareMetalHost
metadata:
  name: example-demo
  labels:
    cluster-role: control-plane
spec:
  architecture: x86_64
  online: true
  bootMACAddress: ${BMC_MAC}
  rootDeviceHints:
    deviceName: /dev/nvme0n1
  bmc:
    address: ${BMC_ADDRESS}
    disableCertificateVerification: true
    credentialsName: example-demo-credentials
----
where:

- `$\{BMC_USERNAME\}` — The user name for the `BMC` of the new bare-metal host.
- `$\{BMC_PASSWORD\}` — The password for the `BMC` of the new bare-metal host.
- `$\{BMC_MAC\}` — The `MAC` address of the new bare-metal host to be used.
- `$\{BMC_ADDRESS\}` — The `URL` for the bare-metal host `BMC` (for example, `redfish-virtualmedia://192.168.200.75/redfish/v1/Systems/1/`). To learn more about the different options available depending on your hardware provider, check the following https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/blob/main/docs/api.md[link].

[NOTE]
====
* Architecture must be either `x86_64` or `aarch64`, depending on the architecture of the bare-metal host to be enrolled.
* If no network configuration for the host has been specified, either at image build time or through the `BareMetalHost` definition, an autoconfiguration mechanism (DHCP, DHCPv6, SLAAC) will be used. For more details or complex configurations, check the xref:advanced-network-configuration[].
====

Once the file is created, the following command has to be executed in the management cluster to start enrolling the new bare-metal host in the management cluster:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f bmh-example.yaml
----

The new bare-metal host object will be enrolled, changing its state from registering to inspecting and available. The changes can be checked using the following command:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl get bmh
----

[NOTE]
====
The `BaremetalHost` object is in the `registering` state until the `BMC` credentials are validated. Once the credentials are validated, the `BaremetalHost` object changes its state to `inspecting`, and this step could take some time depending on the hardware (up to 20 minutes). During the inspecting phase, the hardware information is retrieved and the Kubernetes object is updated. Check the information using the following command: `kubectl get bmh -o yaml`.
====

[#single-node-provision]
*Provision step*

Once the bare-metal host is enrolled and available, the next step is to provision the bare-metal host to install and configure the operating system and the Kubernetes cluster.
To do that, the following file (`capi-provisioning-example.yaml`) has to be created in the management-cluster with the following information (the `capi-provisioning-example.yaml` can be generated by joining the following blocks).

[NOTE]
====
Only values between `$\{...\}` must be replaced with the real values.
====

The following block is the cluster definition, where the networking can be configured using the `pods` and the `services` blocks. Also, it contains the references to the control plane and the infrastructure (using the `Metal^3^` provider) objects to be used.

The `RKE2ControlPlane` object specifies the control-plane configuration to be used and the `Metal3MachineTemplate` object specifies the control-plane image to be used.
Also, it contains the information about the number of replicas to be used (in this case, one) and the `CNI` plug-in to be used (in this case, `Cilium`).
The agentConfig block contains the `Ignition` format to be used and the `additionalUserData` to be used to configure the `RKE2` node with information like a systemd named `rke2-preinstall.service` to replace automatically the `BAREMETALHOST_UUID` and `node-name` during the provisioning process using the Ironic information.
To enable multus with cilium a file is created in the `rke2` server manifests directory named `rke2-cilium-config.yaml` with the configuration to be used.
The last block of information contains the Kubernetes version to be used. `$\{RKE2_VERSION\}` is the version of `RKE2` to be used replacing this value (for example, `{version-kubernetes-rke2}`).

=== Downstream cluster provisioning with Directed network provisioning (multi-node)

This section describes the workflow used to automate the provisioning of a multi-node downstream cluster using directed network provisioning and `MetalLB` as a load-balancer strategy.
This is the simplest way to automate the provisioning of a downstream cluster. The following diagram shows the workflow used to automate the provisioning of a multi-node downstream cluster using directed network provisioning and `MetalLB`.



*Requirements*

- The image generated using `EIB`, as described in the xref:eib-edge-image-connected[previous section], with the minimal configuration to set up the downstream cluster has to be located in the management cluster exactly on the path you configured on xref:metal3-media-server[this section].
- The management server created and available to be used on the following sections. For more information, refer to the Management Cluster section: <<atip-management-cluster>>.

*Workflow*

The following diagram shows the workflow used to automate the provisioning of a multi-node downstream cluster using directed network provisioning:

image::atip-automate-multinode1.png[scaledwidth=100%]

1. Enroll the three bare-metal hosts to make them available for the provisioning process.
2. Provision the three bare-metal hosts to install and configure the operating system and the Kubernetes cluster using `MetalLB`.

*Enroll the bare-metal hosts*

The first step is to enroll the three bare-metal hosts in the management cluster to make them available to be provisioned.
To do that, the following files (`bmh-example-node1.yaml`, `bmh-example-node2.yaml` and `bmh-example-node3.yaml`) must be created in the management cluster, to specify the `BMC` credentials to be used and the `BaremetalHost` object to be enrolled in the management cluster.

[NOTE]
====
* Only the values between `$\{...\}` have to be replaced with the real values.
* We will walk you through the process for only one host. The same steps apply to the other two nodes.
====

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1

  bmc:
    address: ${BMC_NODE1_ADDRESS}
    disableCertificateVerification: true
    credentialsName: node1-example-credentials
----

Where:

- `$\{BMC_NODE1_USERNAME\}` — The username for the BMC of the first bare-metal host.
- `$\{BMC_NODE1_PASSWORD\}` — The password for the BMC of the first bare-metal host.
- `$\{BMC_NODE1_MAC\}` — The MAC address of the first bare-metal host to be used.
- `$\{BMC_NODE1_ADDRESS\}` — The URL for the first bare-metal host BMC (for example, `redfish-virtualmedia://192.168.200.75/redfish/v1/Systems/1/`). The host part of the URL can be an IP address (v4 or v6) or a domain name, where the existing infrastructure allows. To learn more about the different options available depending on your hardware provider, check the following https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/blob/main/docs/api.md[link].

[NOTE]
====
* If no network configuration for the host has been specified, either at image build time or through the `BareMetalHost` definition, an autoconfiguration mechanism (DHCP, DHCPv6, SLAAC) will be used. For more details or complex configurations, check the xref:advanced-network-configuration[].
* Single-stack IPv6 clusters are in tech preview status and not yet officially supported.
* Architecture must be either `x86_64` or `aarch64`, depending on the architecture of the bare-metal host to be enrolled.
* All modern servers come with a dual-stack capable BMC, however IPv6 support (and possibly the option of using hostnames for the VirtualMedia capability) should be verified before use in production in a dual-stack environment.
====

Once the file is created, the following command must be executed in the management cluster to start enrolling the bare-metal hosts in the management cluster:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f bmh-example-node1.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f bmh-example-node2.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f bmh-example-node3.yaml
----

The new bare-metal host objects are enrolled, changing their state from registering to inspecting and available. The changes can be checked using the following command:

[,shell]
----
$ kubectl get bmh -o wide
----

[NOTE]
====
The `BaremetalHost` object is in the `registering` state until the `BMC` credentials are validated. Once the credentials are validated, the `BaremetalHost` object changes its state to `inspecting`, and this step could take some time depending on the hardware (up to 20 minutes). During the inspecting phase, the hardware information is retrieved and the Kubernetes object is updated. Check the information using the following command: `kubectl get bmh -o yaml`.
====

*Provision step*

Once the three bare-metal hosts are enrolled and available, the next step is to provision the bare-metal hosts to install and configure the operating system and the Kubernetes cluster, creating a load balancer to manage them.
To do that, the following file (`capi-provisioning-example.yaml`) must be created in the management cluster with the following information (the `capi-provisioning-example.yaml can be generated by joining the following blocks).

[NOTE]
====
- Only values between `$\{...\}` must be replaced with the real values.
- The `VIP` address is a reserved IP address that is not assigned to any node and is used to configure the load balancer. In a dual-stack cluster, both an IPv4 and IPv6 can be specified, but in the following examples priority will be given to the IPv4 address.
====

Below is the cluster definition, where the cluster network can be configured using the `pods` and the `services` blocks. Also, it contains the references to the control plane and the infrastructure (using the `Metal^3^` provider) objects to be used.

[#advanced-network-configuration]
=== Advanced Network Configuration

The directed network provisioning workflow allows for specific network configurations in downstream clusters, such as static IPs, bonding, VLANs, IPv6, etc.

The following sections describe the additional steps required to enable provisioning downstream clusters using advanced network configuration.

*Requirements*

- The image generated using `EIB` has to include the network folder and the script following <<add-network-eib,this section>>.

*Configuration*

Before proceeding refer to one of the following sections for guidance on the steps required to enroll and provision the host(s):

* xref:single-node[Downstream cluster provisioning with Directed network provisioning (single-node)]
* xref:multi-node[Downstream cluster provisioning with Directed network provisioning (multi-node)]

Any advanced network configuration must be applied at enrollment time through the `BareMetalHost` host definition and an associated Secret containing an `nmstate` formatted `networkData` block. The following example file defines a secret containing the required `networkData` that requests a static `IP` and `VLAN` for the downstream cluster host:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: controlplane-0-networkdata
type: Opaque
stringData:
  networkData: |
    interfaces:
    - name: ${CONTROLPLANE_INTERFACE}
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      mtu: 1500
      identifier: mac-address
      mac-address: "${CONTROLPLANE_MAC}"
      ipv4:
        address:
        - ip:  "${CONTROLPLANE_IP}"
          prefix-length: "${CONTROLPLANE_PREFIX}"
        enabled: true
        dhcp: false
    - name: floating
      type: vlan
      state: up
      vlan:
        base-iface: ${CONTROLPLANE_INTERFACE}
        id: ${VLAN_ID}
    dns-resolver:
      config:
        server:
        - "${DNS_SERVER}"
    routes:
      config:
      - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
        next-hop-address: "${CONTROLPLANE_GATEWAY}"
        next-hop-interface: ${CONTROLPLANE_INTERFACE}
----

As you can see, the example shows the configuration to enable the interface with static IPs, as well as the configuration to enable the VLAN using the base interface, once the following variables are replaced with the actual values, according to your infrastructure:

- `$\{CONTROLPLANE_INTERFACE\}` — The control-plane interface to be used for the edge cluster (for example, `eth0`). Including `identifier: mac-address` the naming is inspected automatically by the MAC address so any interface name can be used.
- `$\{CONTROLPLANE_IP\}` — The IP address to be used as an endpoint for the edge cluster (must match with the kubeapi-server endpoint).
- `$\{CONTROLPLANE_PREFIX\}` — The CIDR to be used for the edge cluster (for example, `24` if you want `/24` or `255.255.255.0`).
- `$\{CONTROLPLANE_GATEWAY\}` — The gateway to be used for the edge cluster (for example, `192.168.100.1`).
- `$\{CONTROLPLANE_MAC\}` — The MAC address to be used for the control-plane interface (for example, `00:0c:29:3e:3e:3e`).
- `$\{DNS_SERVER\}` — The DNS to be used for the edge cluster (for example, `192.168.100.2`).
- `$\{VLAN_ID\}` — The VLAN ID to be used for the edge cluster (for example, `100`).

Any other `nmstate`-compliant definition can be used to configure the network for the downstream cluster to adapt to the specific requirements. For example, it is possible to specify a static dual-stack configuration:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: controlplane-0-networkdata
type: Opaque
stringData:
  networkData: |
    interfaces:
    - name: ${CONTROLPLANE_INTERFACE}
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      mac-address: ${CONTROLPLANE_MAC}
      ipv4:
        enabled: true
        dhcp: false
        address:
        - ip: ${CONTROLPLANE_IP_V4}
          prefix-length: ${CONTROLPLANE_PREFIX_V4}
      ipv6:
        enabled: true
        dhcp: false
        autoconf: false
        address:
        - ip: ${CONTROLPLANE_IP_V6}
          prefix-length: ${CONTROLPLANE_PREFIX_V6}
    routes:
      config:
      - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
        next-hop-address: ${CONTROLPLANE_GATEWAY_V4}
        next-hop-interface: ${CONTROLPLANE_INTERFACE}
      - destination: ::/0
        next-hop-address: ${CONTROLPLANE_GATEWAY_V6}
        next-hop-interface: ${CONTROLPLANE_INTERFACE}
    dns-resolver:
      config:
        server:
        - ${DNS_SERVER_V4}
        - ${DNS_SERVER_V6}
----

As for the previous example, replace the following variables with actual values, according to your infrastructure:

- `$\{CONTROLPLANE_IP_V4\}` - the IPv4 address to assign to the host
- `$\{CONTROLPLANE_PREFIX_V4\}` - the IPv4 prefix of the network to which the host IP belongs
- `$\{CONTROLPLANE_IP_V6\}` - the IPv6 address to assign to the host
- `$\{CONTROLPLANE_PREFIX_V6\}` - the IPv6 prefix of the network to which the host IP belongs
- `$\{CONTROLPLANE_GATEWAY_V4\}` - the IPv4 address of the gateway for the traffic matching the default route
- `$\{CONTROLPLANE_GATEWAY_V6\}` - the IPv6 address of the gateway for the traffic matching the default route
- `$\{CONTROLPLANE_INTERFACE\}` - the name of the interface to assign the addresses to and to use for egress traffic matching the default route, for both IPv4 and IPv6
- `$\{DNS_SERVER_V4\}` and/or `$\{DNS_SERVER_V6\}` - the IP address(es) of the DNS server(s) to use, which can be specified as single or multiple entries. Both IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses are supported

[NOTE]
====
* You can refer to https://github.com/suse-edge/telco-cloud-examples/tree/main/telco-examples/edge-clusters[SUSE Telco Cloud examples repo] for more complex examples, including IPv6 only and dual-stack configurations.
* Single-stack IPv6 deployments are in tech preview status and not yet officially supported.
====

Lastly, regardless of the network configuration details, ensure that the secret is referenced by appending `preprovisioningNetworkDataName` to the `BaremetalHost` object to successfully enroll the host in the management cluster.

kind: Secret

[NOTE]
====
* If you need to deploy a multi-node cluster, the same process must be done for each node.
* The `Metal3DataTemplate`, `networkData` and `Metal3 IPAM` are currently not supported; only the configuration via static secrets is fully supported.
* Architecture must be either `x86_64` or `aarch64`, depending on the architecture of the bare-metal host to be enrolled.

[#add-telco]
===  Telco features (DPDK, SR-IOV, CPU isolation, huge pages, NUMA, etc.)

The directed network provisioning workflow allows to automate the Telco features to be used in the downstream clusters to run Telco workloads on top of those servers.

*Requirements*

- The image generated using `EIB`, as described in the xref:eib-edge-image-connected[previous section],  has to be located in the management cluster exactly on the path you configured on xref:metal3-media-server[this section].
- The image generated using `EIB` has to include the specific Telco packages following xref:add-telco-feature-eib[this section].
- The management server created and available to be used on the following sections. For more information, refer to the Management Cluster section: <<atip-management-cluster>>.

*Configuration*

Use the following two sections as the base to enroll and provision the hosts:

* xref:single-node[Downstream cluster provisioning with Directed network provisioning (single-node)]
* xref:multi-node[Downstream cluster provisioning with Directed network provisioning (multi-node)]

The Telco features covered in this section are the following:

* DPDK and VFs creation
* SR-IOV and VFs allocation to be used by the workloads
* CPU isolation and performance tuning
* Huge pages configuration
* Kernel parameters tuning

[NOTE]
====
For more information about the Telco features, see <<atip-features>>.
====

The changes required to enable the Telco features shown above are all inside the `RKE2ControlPlane` block in the provision file `capi-provisioning-example.yaml`. The rest of the information inside the file `capi-provisioning-example.yaml` is the same as the information provided in the xref:single-node-provision[provisioning section].

To make the process clear, the changes required on that block (`RKE2ControlPlane`) to enable the Telco features are the following:

* The `preRKE2Commands` to be used to execute the commands before the `RKE2` installation process. In this case, use the `modprobe` command to enable the `vfio-pci` and the `SR-IOV` kernel modules.
* The ignition file `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/configmap-sriov-custom-auto.yaml` to be used to define the interfaces, drivers and the number of `VFs` to be created and exposed to the workloads.
    ** The values inside the config map `sriov-custom-auto-config` are the only values to be replaced with real values.
        *** `$\{RESOURCE_NAME1\}` — The resource name to be used for the first `PF` interface (for example, `sriov-resource-du1`). It is added to the prefix `rancher.io` to be used as a label to be used by the workloads (for example, `rancher.io/sriov-resource-du1`).
        *** `$\{SRIOV-NIC-NAME1\}` — The name of the first `PF` interface to be used (for example, `eth0`).
        *** `$\{PF_NAME1\}` — The name of the first physical function `PF` to be used. Generate more complex filters using this (for example, `eth0#2-5`).
        *** `$\{DRIVER_NAME1\}` — The driver name to be used for the first `VF` interface (for example, `vfio-pci`).
        *** `$\{NUM_VFS1\}` — The number of `VFs` to be created for the first `PF` interface (for example, `8`).
* The `/var/sriov-auto-filler.sh` to be used as a translator between the high-level config map `sriov-custom-auto-config` and the `sriovnetworknodepolicy` which contains the low-level hardware information. This script has been created to abstract the user from the complexity to know in advance the hardware information. No changes are required in this file, but it should be present if we need to enable `sr-iov` and create `VFs`.
* The kernel arguments to be used to enable the following features:

|===
| Parameter | Value | Description
| isolcpus| domain,nohz,managed_irq,1-30,33-62| Isolate the cores 1-30 and 33-62.

|===

* The following systemd services are used to enable the following:
    ** `rke2-preinstall.service` to replace automatically the `BAREMETALHOST_UUID` and `node-name` during the provisioning process using the Ironic information.
    ** `cpu-partitioning.service` to enable the isolation cores of the `CPU` (for example, `1-30,33-62`).
    ** `performance-settings.service` to enable the CPU performance tuning.
    ** `sriov-custom-auto-vfs.service` to install the `sriov` Helm chart, wait until custom resources are created and run the `/var/sriov-auto-filler.sh` to replace the values in the config map `sriov-custom-auto-config` and create the `sriovnetworknodepolicy` to be used by the workloads.

* The `$\{RKE2_VERSION\}` is the version of `RKE2` to be used replacing this value (for example, `{version-kubernetes-rke2}`).

With all these changes mentioned, the `RKE2ControlPlane` block in the `capi-provisioning-example.yaml` will look like the following:

[#atip-private-registry]
=== Private registry

It is possible to configure a private registry as a mirror for images used by workloads.

To do this we create the secret containing the information about the private registry to be used by the downstream cluster.

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: private-registry-cert

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: private-registry-auth
  namespace: default
data:
  username: ${REGISTRY_USERNAME}
  password: ${REGISTRY_PASSWORD}
----

The `tls.crt`, `tls.key` and `ca.crt` are the certificates to be used to authenticate the private registry. The `username` and `password` are the credentials to be used to authenticate the private registry.

[NOTE]
====
The `tls.crt`, `tls.key`, `ca.crt` , `username` and `password` have to be encoded in base64 format before to be used in the secret.

[#airgap-deployment]
=== Downstream cluster provisioning in air-gapped scenarios

The directed network provisioning workflow allows to automate the provisioning of downstream clusters in air-gapped scenarios.

==== Requirements for air-gapped scenarios

. The `raw` image generated using `EIB` must include the specific container images (helm-chart OCI and container images) required to run the downstream cluster in an air-gapped scenario. For more information, refer to xref:eib-edge-image-airgap[this section].

. In case of using SR-IOV or any other custom workload, the images required to run the workloads must be preloaded in your private registry following the xref:preload-private-registry[preload private registry section].

==== Enroll the bare-metal hosts in air-gap scenarios

The process to enroll the bare-metal hosts in the management cluster is the same as described in the xref:enroll-bare-metal-host[previous section].

==== Provision the downstream cluster in air-gap scenarios

There are some important changes required to provision the downstream cluster in air-gapped scenarios:

. The `RKE2ControlPlane` block in the `capi-provisioning-example.yaml` file must include the `spec.agentConfig.airGapped: true` directive.

. The private registry configuration must be included in the `RKE2ControlPlane` block in the `capi-provisioning-airgap-example.yaml` file following the xref:atip-private-registry[private registry section].

. If you are using SR-IOV or any other `AdditionalUserData` configuration (combustion script) which requires the helm-chart installation, you must modify the content to reference the private registry instead of using the public registry.

The following example shows the SR-IOV configuration in the `AdditionalUserData` block in the `capi-provisioning-airgap-example.yaml` file with the modifications required to reference the private registry

- Private Registry secrets references
- Helm-Chart definition using the private registry instead of the public OCI images.
