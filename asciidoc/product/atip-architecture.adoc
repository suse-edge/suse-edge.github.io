SUSE ATIP is a platform designed for hosting modern, cloud native, Telco applications at scale from core to edge.

This page explains the architecture and components used in ATIP. Knowledge of this helps deploy and use ATIP.


=== ATIP Architecture

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of ATIP:

=== Components

There are two different blocks, the management stack and the runtime stack:

* *Management stack*: This is the part of ATIP that is used to manage the provision and lifecycle of the runtime stacks. It includes the following components:
  ** Multi-cluster management in public and private cloud environments with <<components-rancher,Rancher>>
  ** Bare-metal support with <<components-metal3,Metal^3^>>, <<components-metallb,MetalLB>> and `CAPI` (Cluster API) infrastructure providers
  ** Comprehensive tenant isolation and `IDP` (Identity Provider) integrations
  ** Large marketplace of third-party integrations and extensions
  ** Vendor-neutral API and rich ecosystem of providers
  ** Control the SLE Micro transactional updates
  ** GitOps Engine for managing the lifecycle of the clusters using Git repositories with <<components-fleet,Fleet>>

* *Runtime stack*: This is the part of ATIP that is used to run the workloads.
  ** Kubernetes with secure and lightweight distributions like <<components-k3s,K3s>> and <<components-rke2,RKE2>> (`RKE2` is hardened, certified and optimized for government use and regulated industries).
  ** <<components-neuvector,NeuVector>> to enable security features like image vulnerability scanning, deep packet inspection and automatic intra-cluster traffic control.
  ** Block Storage with <<components-longhorn,Longhorn>> to enable a simple and easy way to use a cloud native storage solution.
  ** Optimized Operating System with <<components-slmicro,SLE Micro>> to enable a secure, lightweight and immutable (transactional file system) OS for running containers. SLE Micro is available on `aarch64` and `x86_64` architectures, and it also supports `Real-Time Kernel` for Telco and edge use cases.

=== Example deployment flows

The following are high-level examples of workflows to understand the relationship between the management and the runtime components.

Directed network provisioning is the workflow that enables the deployment of a new downstream cluster with all the components preconfigured and ready to run workloads with no manual intervention.

==== Example 1: Deploying a new management cluster with all components installed

Using the <<components-eib,Edge Image Builder>> to create a new `ISO` image with the management stack included. You can then use this `ISO` image to install a new management cluster on VMs or bare-metal.

NOTE: For more information about how to deploy a new management cluster, see the <<atip-management-cluster,ATIP Management Cluster guide>>.

NOTE: For more information about how to use the Edge Image Builder, see the <<quickstart-eib,Edge Image Builder guide>>.


==== Example 2: Deploying a single-node downstream cluster with Telco profiles to enable it to run Telco workloads

Once we have the management cluster up and running, we can use it to deploy a single-node downstream cluster with all Telco capabilities enabled and configured using the directed network provisioning workflow.

The following diagram shows the high-level workflow to deploy it:

NOTE: For more information about how to deploy a downstream cluster, see the <<atip-automated-provisioning,ATIP Automated Provisioning guide.>>

NOTE: For more information about Telco features, see the <<atip-features,ATIP Telco Features guide.>>

==== Example 3: Deploying a high availability downstream cluster using MetalLB as a Load Balancer

Once we have the management cluster up and running, we can use it to deploy a high availability downstream cluster with `MetalLB` as a load balancer using the directed network provisioning workflow.

The following diagram shows the high-level workflow to deploy it:
