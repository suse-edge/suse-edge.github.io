SUSE Edge for Telco is a platform designed for hosting modern, cloud native, Telco applications at scale from core to edge.

This page explains the architecture and components used in SUSE Edge for Telco.


=== SUSE Edge for Telco Architecture

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of SUSE Edge for Telco:

=== Components

There are two different blocks, the management stack and the runtime stack:

* *Management stack*: This is the part of SUSE Edge for Telco that is used to manage the provision and lifecycle of the runtime stacks. It includes the following components:
  ** Multi-cluster management in public and private cloud environments with <<components-rancher,Rancher>>
  ** Bare-metal support with <<components-metal3,Metal^3^>>, <<components-metallb,MetalLB>> and `CAPI` (Cluster API) infrastructure providers
  ** Comprehensive tenant isolation and `IDP` (Identity Provider) integrations
  ** Large marketplace of third-party integrations and extensions
  ** Vendor-neutral API and rich ecosystem of providers
  ** Control the SUSE Linux Micro transactional updates
  ** GitOps Engine for managing the lifecycle of the clusters using Git repositories with <<components-fleet,Fleet>>

* *Runtime stack*: This is the part of SUSE Edge for Telco that is used to run the workloads.
  ** Kubernetes with secure and lightweight distributions like <<components-k3s,K3s>> and <<components-rke2,RKE2>> (`RKE2` is hardened, certified and optimized for government use and regulated industries).
  ** <<components-suse-security,SUSE Security>> to enable security features like image vulnerability scanning, deep packet inspection and automatic intra-cluster traffic control.
  ** Block Storage with <<components-suse-storage,SUSE Storage>> to enable a simple and easy way to use a cloud native storage solution.
  ** Optimized Operating System with <<components-slmicro,SUSE Linux Micro>> to enable a secure, lightweight and immutable (transactional file system) OS for running containers. SUSE Linux Micro is available on {aarch64} and {x86-64} architectures, and it also supports `Real-Time Kernel` for Telco and edge use cases.

=== Example deployment flows

The following are high-level examples of workflows to understand the relationship between the management and the runtime components.

Directed network provisioning is the workflow that enables the deployment of a new downstream cluster with all the components preconfigured and ready to run workloads with no manual intervention.

==== Example 1: Deploying a new management cluster with all components installed

Using the <<components-eib,Edge Image Builder>> to create a new `ISO` image with the management stack included. You can then use this `ISO` image to install a new management cluster on VMs or bare-metal.

NOTE: For more information about how to deploy a new management cluster, see the <<atip-management-cluster,SUSE Edge for Telco Management Cluster guide>>.

NOTE: For more information about how to use the Edge Image Builder, see the <<quickstart-eib,Edge Image Builder guide>>.


==== Example 2: Deploying a single-node downstream cluster with Telco profiles to enable it to run Telco workloads

Once we have the management cluster up and running, we can use it to deploy a single-node downstream cluster with all Telco capabilities enabled and configured using the directed network provisioning workflow.

The following diagram shows the high-level workflow to deploy it:

NOTE: For more information about Telco features, see the <<atip-features,SUSE Edge for Telco Telco Features guide.>>

==== Example 3: Deploying a high availability downstream cluster using MetalLB as a Load Balancer

Once we have the management cluster up and running, we can use it to deploy a high availability downstream cluster with `MetalLB` as a load balancer using the directed network provisioning workflow.

The following diagram shows the high-level workflow to deploy it:
