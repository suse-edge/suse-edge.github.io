Before diving into component-specific issues, consider these general principles:

* *Check logs*: Logs are the primary source of information. Most of the times the errors are self explanatory and contain hints on what failed.
* *Check clocks*: Having clock differences between systems can lead to all kinds of different errors. Ensure clocks are in sync. EIB can be instructed to force clock sync at boot time, see <<quickstart-eib,Configuring OS Time>>.
* *Boot Issues*: If the system is stuck during boot, note down the last messages displayed. Access the console (physical or via BMC) to observe boot messages.
* *Network Issues*: Verify network interface configuration (`ip a`), routing table (`ip route`), test connectivity from/to other nodes and external services (`ping`, `nc`). Ensure firewall rules are not blocking necessary ports.
* *Verify component status*: Use `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe` for Kubernetes resources. Use `kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' -n <namespace>` to see the events on a particular Kubernetes namespace.
* *Verify services status*: Use `systemctl status <service>` for systemd services.
* *Check syntax*: Software expects certain structure and syntax on configuration files. For yaml files, for example, use `yamllint` or similar tools to verify the proper syntax.
* *Isolate the problem*: Try to narrow down the issue to a specific component or layer (for example, network, storage, OS, Kubernetes, Metal^3^, Ironic,...).
* *Documentation*: Always refer to the official https://documentation.suse.com/suse-edge/[SUSE Edge documentation] and also upstream documentation for detailed information.
* *Versions*: SUSE Edge is an opinionated and thorough tested version of different SUSE components. he versions of each component per SUSE Edge release can be observed in the https://documentation.suse.com/suse-edge/support-matrix/html/support-matrix/index.html[SUSE Edge support matrix].
* *Known issues*: For each SUSE Edge release there is a “Known issues” section on the release notes that contains information of issues that will be fixed on future releases but can affect the current one.
