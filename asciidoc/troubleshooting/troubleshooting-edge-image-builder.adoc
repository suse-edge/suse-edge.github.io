EIB is used to create custom SUSE Edge images.

.Common Issues

* *Wrong SCC code*: Ensure the SCC code used in the EIB definition file matches the SL Micro version and architecture.
* *Missing dependencies*: Ensure there are no missing packages or tools within the build environment.
* *Incorrect image size*: For raw images, the `diskSize` parameter is required and it depends heavily on the images, RPMs, and other artifacts being included in the image.
* *Permissions*: If storing a script on the custom/files directory, ensure it has executable permissions as those files are just available at combustion time but no changes are performed by EIB. 
* *Operating system group dependencies*: When creating an image with custom users and groups, the groups being set as “`primaryGroup`” should be explicitly created.
* *Operating system user's sshkeys requires a home folder*: When creating an image with users with sshkeys, the home folder needs to be created as well with `createHomeDir=true`.
* *Combustion issues*: EIB relies on combustion for the customization of the OS and deployment of all the other SUSE Edge components. This also includes custom scripts being placed in the custom/scripts folder. Note that the combustion process is being executed at `initrd` time, so the system is not completely booted when the scripts are executed.
* *Podman machine size*: As explained in the <<tips-and-tricks,EIB Tips and Tricks section>>, verify the podman machine has enough CPU/memory to run the EIB container on non-Linux operating systems.

.Logs

* *EIB output*: The console output of the `eib build` command is crucial.
* *Build container logs*: Check the logs of the build container. The logs are generated in the directory that was used to store the artifacts. Check `docker logs` or `podman logs` for  the necessary information as well.

* *Temporary build directories*: EIB creates temporary directories during the build process. Check these for intermediate logs or artifacts if the main output is insufficient.
* *Combustion logs*: If the image being built with EIB does not boot for any reason, a root shell is available. Connect to the host console (either physically, via BMC, etc.) and check combustion logs with `journalctl -u combustion` and in general all the operating system logs with `journalctl` to find the root cause of the failure.


.Troubleshooting steps

. *Review `eib-build` output*: The error message in the console output is usually very indicative.
. *Check build environment*: Ensure all prerequisites for EIB itself (for example, docker/podman, sufficient disk space) are met on the machine running EIB.
. *Inspect build container logs*: Review the logs of the failed container for more detailed errors (see above).
. *Verify `eib` configuration"*: Double-check the `eib` configuration file for any typos or incorrect paths to source files or build scripts.
* *Test components individually*: If your EIB build involves custom scripts or stages, run them independently to isolate failures.
