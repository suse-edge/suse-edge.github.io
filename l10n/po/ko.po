"SUSE Edge is a purpose-built, tightly integrated, and comprehensively "
"validated end-to-end solution for addressing the unique challenges of the "
"deployment of infrastructure and cloud-native applications at the edge. Its "
"driving focus is to provide an opinionated, yet highly flexible, highly "
"scalable, and secure platform that spans initial deployment image building, "
"node provisioning and onboarding, application deployment, observability, and "
"complete lifecycle operations. The platform is built on best-of-breed open "
"source software from the ground up, consistent with both our 30-year+ "
"history in delivering secure, stable, and certified SUSE Linux platforms and "
"our experience in providing highly scalable and feature-rich Kubernetes "
"management with our Rancher portfolio. SUSE Edge builds on-top of these "
"capabilities to deliver functionality that can address a wide number of "
"market segments, including retail, medical, transportation, logistics, "
"telecommunications, smart manufacturing, and Industrial IoT."

"The solution is designed with the notion that there is no \"one-size-fits-"
"all\" edge platform due to customers’ widely varying requirements and "
"expectations. Edge deployments push us to solve, and continually evolve, "
"some of the most challenging problems, including massive scalability, "
"restricted network availability, physical space constraints, new security "
"threats and attack vectors, variations in hardware architecture and system "
"resources, the requirement to deploy and interface with legacy "
"infrastructure and applications, and customer solutions that have extended "
"lifespans. Since many of these challenges are different from traditional "
"ways of thinking, e.g. deployment of infrastructure and applications within "
"data centers or in the public cloud, we have to look into the design in much "
"more granular detail, and rethinking many common assumptions."

"For example, we find value in minimalism, modularity, and ease of "
"operations. Minimalism is important for edge environments since the more "
"complex a system is, the more likely it is to break. When looking at "
"hundreds of locations, up to hundreds of thousands, complex systems will "
"break in complex ways. Modularity in our solution allows for more user "
"choice while removing unneeded complexity in the deployed platform. We also "
"need to balance these with the ease of operations. Humans may make mistakes "
"when repeating a process thousands of times, so the platform should make "
"sure any potential mistakes are recoverable, eliminating the need for on-"
