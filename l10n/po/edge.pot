"SUSE Edge is a purpose-built, tightly integrated, and comprehensively "
"validated end-to-end solution for addressing the unique challenges of the "
"deployment of infrastructure and cloud-native applications at the edge. Its "
"driving focus is to provide an opinionated, yet highly flexible, highly "
"scalable, and secure platform that spans initial deployment image building, "
"node provisioning and onboarding, application deployment, observability, and "
"complete lifecycle operations. The platform is built on best-of-breed open "
"source software from the ground up, consistent with both our 30-year+ "
"history in delivering secure, stable, and certified SUSE Linux platforms and "
"our experience in providing highly scalable and feature-rich Kubernetes "
"management with our Rancher portfolio. SUSE Edge builds on-top of these "
"capabilities to deliver functionality that can address a wide number of "
"market segments, including retail, medical, transportation, logistics, "
"telecommunications, smart manufacturing, and Industrial IoT."

"The solution is designed with the notion that there is no "
"\"one-size-fits-all\" edge platform due to customers’ widely varying "
"requirements and expectations. Edge deployments push us to solve, and "
"continually evolve, some of the most challenging problems, including massive "
"scalability, restricted network availability, physical space constraints, "
"new security threats and attack vectors, variations in hardware architecture "
"and system resources, the requirement to deploy and interface with legacy "
"infrastructure and applications, and customer solutions that have extended "
"lifespans. Since many of these challenges are different from traditional "
"ways of thinking, e.g. deployment of infrastructure and applications within "
"data centers or in the public cloud, we have to look into the design in much "
"more granular detail, and rethinking many common assumptions."

"For example, we find value in minimalism, modularity, and ease of "
"operations. Minimalism is important for edge environments since the more "
"complex a system is, the more likely it is to break. When looking at "
"hundreds of locations, up to hundreds of thousands, complex systems will "
"break in complex ways. Modularity in our solution allows for more user "
"choice while removing unneeded complexity in the deployed platform. We also "
"need to balance these with the ease of operations. Humans may make mistakes "
"when repeating a process thousands of times, so the platform should make "
"sure any potential mistakes are recoverable, eliminating the need for "
"on-site technician visits, but also strive for consistency and "
"standardization."

"The high level system architecture of SUSE Edge is broken into two core "

"Please note that SUSE must occasionally deprecate features or change API "
"specifications. Reasons for feature deprecation or API change could include "
"a feature being updated or replaced by a new implementation, a new feature "
"set, upstream technology is no longer available, or the upstream community "
"has introduced incompatible changes. It is not intended that this will ever "
"happen within a given minor release (x.z), and so all z-stream releases will "
"maintain API compatibility and feature functionality. SUSE will endeavor to "
"provide deprecation warnings with plenty of notice within the release notes, "
"along with workarounds, suggestions, and mitigations to minimize service "
"disruption."
