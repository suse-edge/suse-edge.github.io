Each method has their own benefits and drawbacks. Kiwi supports using the package manager from the host/build system, so it can build base images and derive images which don't contain a package manager, like opensuse/busybox. With Dockerfile, it's practically required to use a full base image like opensuse/tumbleweed. I won't go into details how a Dockerfile or a kiwi build works, I'll just tell about the interaction with OBS. First the kiwi_metainfo_helper service that you can add as a buildtime source service allows to substitute buildtime placeholders to use in you Dockerfile or kiwi configuration. You can find a list of the placeholders here: https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/openSUSE:Factory/obs-service-kiwi_metainfo_helper/README Another useful service is the replace_using_package_version service, that allows to replace a placeholder with the version of a RPM package.

It is based on the concept of a transactional server, where the entire operating system is treated as a single, immutable unit. This means that any changes to the system are made through atomic transactions, which can be rolled back if necessary. This approach provides increased security, reliability, and consistency, making it ideal for use in production environments. It includes only the essential components required to run container workloads and has a small footprint, making it ideal for running in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices or IoT devices. SLE Micro can be used as a single-node container host, Kubernetes cluster node, single-node KVM virtualization host or in public cloud. One of the main benefits of using SLE Micro is its open standards design, which allows users to explore commodity hardware from several vendors and build an open source-based software platform. This enables significant cost savings on both software and hardware while keeping full control of the technology stack strategy and roadmap. One example for the usage would be Telecom where SLE Micro is helping them unlock the cost-savings potential of open-source design for both software and hardware. With the open standards design, they can explore commodity hardware from several vendors and build an open source-based software platform using open standards such as Kubernetes with open source tools of their choice.

If the first node is down, the clients needs their API endpoint to be tweaked to point to another node (i.e.- for kubectl, using the -s flag or modifying the kubeconfig file) and the certificate won't be accepted as it doesn't contain the IP/hostname of that other node (it can be forced to be ignored using --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true for kubectl but that's not a good practice). Ideally a mechanism to expose the K3s API in a high availability scenario is required. This usually means running a load balancer outside of the K3s cluster to serve and redirect the requests to the K3s API endpoints, so if one of the servers fail, the load balancer will re-route the requests to the other ones. This solves the HA problem but it adds complexity as it requires an external service, which sometimes is not available (typically in non-cloud environments such as baremetal deployments). One approach can be to run a self-contained solution involving kube-vip to expose the K3s API over a virtual IP (optionally including a load balancer as well). This solves the HA problem but the certificate can still be a problem... but K3s got you covered. By using the --tls-san flag at K3s installation time, a list of IPs and/or hostnames can be provided for the certificate to be included as Subject Alternative Names, meaning the K3s API will be happily served from those IPs/hostnames, and if those are the ones being served by the VIP, the solution is now HA and certificate-proof!

When the system is booted for the first time, Ignition is loaded as part of an initramfs and searches for a configuration file within a specific directory (on a USB flash disk, or you can provide a URL). All changes are performed before the kernel switches from the temporal file system to the real root file system (before the switch_root command is issued). Ignition uses a configuration file in the JSON format. The file is called config.ign. SLE Micro supportsIgnition config spec 3.3.0(seehttps://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.3/single-html/SLE-Micro-deployment/#sec-ignition-configurationfor more information). Ignition files can be complex to generate manually (specially for the file permissions syntax in hex or multiline things) so you can useopensuse.github.io/fuel-ignitionto help you generate a basic one. Butane is a more human readable (and writable) configuration syntax based on yaml that can be translated to Ignition easily with the butane CLI as Butane is not consumable by Ignition. Combustion is a dracut module that enables you to configure your system on its first boot. Combustion reads a provided file called script and executes commands in it and thus performs changes to the file system. You can use Combustion to change the default partitions, set users\\' passwords, create files, install packages, etc. The Combustion dracut module is invoked after the ignition.firstboot argument is passed to the kernel command line. Combustion then reads the configuration from script. Combustion tries to configure the network, if the network flag has been found in script. After /sysroot is mounted, Combustion tries to activate all mount points in /etc/fstab and then call transactional-update to apply other changes (like setting root password or installing packages).

This daemon runs on host servers and performs required management tasks for virtualized guests. This includes activities such as starting, stopping and migrating guests between host servers, configuring and manipulating networking, and managing storage for use by guests. The libvirt client libraries and utilities connect to this daemon to issue tasks and collect information about the configuration and resources of the host system and guests.

See the EXAMPLES section at the end of this document to quickly get started.virt-install tool supports both text based &amp; graphical installations, using VNC or SDL graphics, or a text serial console. The guest can be configured to use one or more virtual disks, network interfaces, audio devices, physical USB or PCI devices, among others. The installation media can be held locally or remotely on NFS , HTTP , FTP servers. In the latter case virt-install will fetch the minimal files necessary to kick off the installation process, allowing the guest to fetch the rest of the OS distribution as needed. PXE booting, and importing an existing disk image (thus skipping the install phase) are also supported. To see more details about virt-install options, please visit https://linux.die.net/man/1/virt-installTo see more details about virt-manager and the graphical interface, please visit https://virt-manager.org/ Image-based process step by step We have to create the image based and prepare the image with ignition and combustion files.
